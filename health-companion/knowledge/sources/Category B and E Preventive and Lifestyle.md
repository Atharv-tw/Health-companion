However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such as whole grains. The exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs. However, the basic principles of what constitutes a healthy diet remain the same. For adults A healthy diet includes the following: Fruit, v egeta bles, legumes (e.g . lentils and beans), n uts and whole g rains (e.g . unpr ocessed maiz e, millet, oats, wheat and br own rice). At least 400 g (i.e. fi ve por tions) of fruit and v egeta bles per day (2), ex cluding potatoes, s weet potatoes, cassa va and other starch y r oots.

Healthy diet 2/9 For infants and young children In the first 2 years of a child’s life, optimal nutrition fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development. It also reduces the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life. Advice on a healthy diet for infants and children is similar to that for adults, but the following elements are also important: Inf ants should be br eastfed ex clusi vely during the fir st 6 months of life. Inf ants should be br eastfed contin uousl y until 2 y ear s of age and bey ond. From 6 months of age, br east milk should be complemented with a v ariety of adequate, safe and nutrient-dense f oods. Salt and sugar s should not be added to complementar y f oods. Practical advice on maintaining a healthy diet Fruit and vegetables Eating at least 400 g, or five portions, of fruit and vegetables per day reduces the risk of NCDs (2) and helps to ensure an adequate daily intake of dietary fibre. Fruit and vegetable intake can be improved by: always including v egeta bles in meals; eating fr esh fr uit and ra w v egeta bles as snacks; eating fr esh fr uit and v egeta bles that ar e in season; and eating a v ariety of fruit and v egeta bles. Fats Reducing the amount of total fat intake to less than 30% of total energy intake helps to prevent unhealthy weight gain in the adult population (1, 2, 3). Also, the risk of developing NCDs is lowered by: reducing saturated f ats to less than 10% of total energ y intak e; reducing trans-fats to less than 1% of total energ y intak e; and replacing both saturated f ats and trans-fats with unsaturated f ats (2, 3) – in par ticular , with pol yunsaturated f ats.

Salt, sodium and potassium Most people consume too much sodium through salt (corresponding to consum ing an average of 9–12 g of salt per day) and not enough potassium (less than 3.5 g). High sodium intake and insufficient potassium intake contribute to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke (8, 11). Reducing salt intake to the recommended level of less than 5 g per day could prevent 1.7 million deaths each year (12). People are often unaware of the amount of salt they consume. In many countries, most salt comes from processed foods (e.g. ready meals; processed meats such as bacon, ham and salami; cheese; and salty snacks) or from foods consumed frequently in large amounts (e.g. bread). Salt is also added to foods during cooking (e.g. bouillon, stock cubes, soy sauce and fish sauce) or at the point of consumption (e.g. table salt). Salt intake can be reduced by: limiting the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (e.g . soy sauce, fish sauce and bouillon) when cooking and pr eparing f oods; not ha ving salt or high-sodium sauces on the ta ble; limiting the consumption of salty snacks; and choosing pr oducts with lo wer sodium content. Some food manufacturers are reformulating recipes to reduce the sodium content of their products, and people should be encouraged to check nutrition labels to see how much sodium is in a product before purchasing or consuming it. Potassium can mitigate the negative effects of elevated sodium consumption on blood pressure. Intake of potassium can be increased by consuming fresh fruit and vegetables. Sugars In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7).

Potassium can mitigate the negative effects of elevated sodium consumption on blood pressure. Intake of potassium can be increased by consuming fresh fruit and vegetables. Sugars In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7). A reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake would provide additional health benefits (7).1/13/26, 12:07 AM Healthy diet 4/9 Consuming free sugars increases the risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Excess calories from foods and drinks high in free sugars also contribute to unhealthy weight gain, which can lead to overweight and obesity. Recent evidence also shows that free sugars influence blood pressure and serum lipids, and suggests that a reduction in free sugars intake reduces risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (13). Sugars intake can be reduced by: limiting the consumption of foods and drinks containing high amounts of sugar s, such as sugar y snacks, candies and sugar -sweetened bev era ges (i.e. all types of bev era ges containing fr ee sugar s – these include carbonated or non ‐ carbonated soft drinks, fr uit or v egeta ble juices and drinks, liquid and po wder concentrates, f lavour ed w ater , energ y and spor ts drinks, r eady ‐ to ‐ drink tea, ready ‐ to ‐ drink cof fee and f lavour ed milk drinks); and eating fr esh fr uit and ra w v egeta bles as snacks instead of sugar y snacks. How to promote healthy diets Diet evolves over time, being influenced by many social and economic factors that interact in a complex manner to shape individual dietary patterns. These factors include income, food prices (which will affect the availability and affordability of healthy foods), individual preferences and beliefs, cultural traditions, and geographical and environmental aspects (including climate change). Therefore, promoting a healthy food environment – including food systems that promote a diversified, balanced and healthy diet – requires the involvement of multiple sectors and stakeholders, including government, and the public and private sectors. Governments have a central role in creating a healthy food environment that enables people to adopt and maintain healthy dietary practices. Effective actions by policy-makers

WHO response The “WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health” (14) was adopted in 2004 by the Health Assembly. The strategy called on governments, WHO, international partners, the private sector and civil society to take action at global, regional and local levels to support healthy diets and physical activity. In 2010, the Health Assembly endorsed a set of recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children (15). These recommendations guide countries in designing new policies and improving existing ones to reduce the impact on children of the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children. WHO has also developed region-specific tools (such as regional nutrient profile models) that countries can use to implement the marketing recommendations.

These recommendations guide countries in designing new policies and improving existing ones to reduce the impact on children of the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children. WHO has also developed region-specific tools (such as regional nutrient profile models) that countries can use to implement the marketing recommendations. In 2012, the Health Assembly adopted a “Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition” and six global nutrition targets to be achieved by 2025, including the reduction of stunting, wasting and overweight in children, the improvement of breastfeeding, and the reduction of anaemia and low birthweight (9).1/13/26, 12:07 AM Healthy diet 6/9 In 2013, the Health Assembly agreed to nine global voluntary targets for the prevention and control of NCDs. These targets include a halt to the rise in diabetes and obesity, and a 30% relative reduction in the intake of salt by 2025. The “Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013–2020” (10) provides guidance and policy options for Member States, WHO and other United Nations agencies to achieve the targets. With many countries now seeing a rapid rise in obesity among infants and children, in May 2014 WHO set up the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity. In 2016, the Commission proposed a set of recommendations to successfully tackle childhood and adolescent obesity in different contexts around the world (16). In November 2014, WHO organized, jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2). ICN2 adopted the Rome Declaration on Nutrition (17), and the Framework for Action (18) which recommends a set of policy options and strategies to promote diversified, safe and healthy diets at all stages of life. WHO is helping countries to implement the commitments made at ICN2. In May 2018, the Health Assembly approved the 13th General Programme of Work (GPW13), which will guide the work of WHO in 2019–2023 (19). Reduction of salt/sodium intake and elimination of industrially-produced trans-fats from the food supply are identified in GPW13 as part of WHO’s priority actions to achieve the aims of ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. To support Member States in taking necessary actions to eliminate industrially-produced trans-fats, WHO has developed a roadmap for countries (the

health benefits such as reducing the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life. n Energy intake (calories) should be in balance with energy expenditure. To avoid unhealthy weight gain, total fat should not exceed 30% of total energy intake (1, 2, 3) . Intake of saturated fats should be less than 10% of total energy intake, and intake of trans -fats less than 1% of total energy intake, with a shift in fat consumption away from saturated fats and trans -fats to unsaturated fats (3) , and towards the goal of eliminating industrially- produced trans -fats (4, 5, 6) . n Limiting intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7) is part of a healthy diet. A further reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake is suggested for additional health benefits (7) . n Keeping salt intake to less than 5 g per day (equivalent to sodium intake of less than 2 g per day) helps to prevent hypertension, and reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke in the adult population (8) . n WHO Member States have agreed to reduce the global population’s intake of salt by 30% by 2025; they have also agreed to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity in adults and adolescents as well as in childhood over - weight by 2025 (9, 10) . OVERVIEW Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life-course helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and conditions. However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegeta - bles and other dietary fibre such as whole grains. The exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs. However, the basic principles of what constitutes a healthy diet remain the same. ADULTS A healthy diet includes the following: n Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice). n At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per

and healthy diet will vary depending on individual characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs. However, the basic principles of what constitutes a healthy diet remain the same. ADULTS A healthy diet includes the following: n Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice). n At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day (2) , excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cas - sava and other starchy roots. n Less than 10% of total energy intake from free sugars (2, 7) , which is equivalent to 50 g (or about 12 level tea - spoons) for a person of healthy body weight consuming about 2000 calories per day, but ideally is less than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits (7) . Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. n Less than 30% of total energy intake from fats (1, 2, 3) . Unsaturated fats (found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard) and trans -fats of all kinds, including both industrially-produced trans -fats (found in baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and cooking oils and spreads) and ruminant trans -fats (found in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals, such as cows, sheep, goats and camels). It is suggested that the intake of saturated fats be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake and trans -fats to less than 1% of total energy intake (5). In particular, industrially-produced trans -fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided (4, 6) . n Less than 5 g of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) intake per day (8) . Salt should be iodized. FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN In the first 2 years of a child’s life, optimal nutrition fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development. It also reduces the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life. Advice on a healthy diet

-fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided (4, 6) . n Less than 5 g of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) intake per day (8) . Salt should be iodized. FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN In the first 2 years of a child’s life, optimal nutrition fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development. It also reduces the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life. Advice on a healthy diet for infants and children is similar to that for adults, but the following elements are also important: ■nInfants should be breastfed exclusively during the first 6 months of life. ■nInfants should be breastfed continuously until 2 years of age and beyond. ■nFrom 6 months of age, breast milk should be complemented with a variety of adequate, safe and nutrient-dense foods. Salt and sugars should not be added to complementary foods. PRACTICAL ADVICE ON MAINTAINING A HEALTHY DIET Fruit and vegetables Eating at least 400 g, or five portions, of fruit and vegetables per day reduces the risk of NCDs (2) and helps to ensure an adequate daily intake of dietary fibre. Fruit and vegetable intake can be improved by: n always including vegetables in meals; n eating fresh fruit and raw vegetables as snacks; eating fresh fruit and vegetables that are in season; and n eating a variety of fruit and vegetables. Fats Reducing the amount of total fat intake to less than 30% of total energy intake helps to prevent unhealthy weight gain in the adult population (1, 2, 3) . Also, the risk of developing NCDs is lowered by: n reducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake; n reducing trans -fats to less than 1% of total energy intake; and n replacing both saturated fats and trans -fats with unsaturated fats (2, 3) – in particular, with polyunsaturated fats. Fat intake, especially saturated fat and industrially-produced trans -fat intake, can be reduced by: n steaming or boiling instead of frying when cooking; n replacing butter, lard and ghee with oils rich in polyunsaturated fats, such as soybean, canola (rapeseed), corn, safflower and sunflower oils; n eating reduced-fat dairy foods and lean meats, or trimming visible fat from meat; and n limiting the consumption of baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods (e.g. doughnuts, cakes, pies, cookies, biscuits and wafers) that contain industrially-produced

and industrially-produced trans -fat intake, can be reduced by: n steaming or boiling instead of frying when cooking; n replacing butter, lard and ghee with oils rich in polyunsaturated fats, such as soybean, canola (rapeseed), corn, safflower and sunflower oils; n eating reduced-fat dairy foods and lean meats, or trimming visible fat from meat; and n limiting the consumption of baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods (e.g. doughnuts, cakes, pies, cookies, biscuits and wafers) that contain industrially-produced trans -fats. Salt, sodium and potassium Most people consume too much sodium through salt (consuming an average of 9–12 g of salt per day) and not enough potassium (less than 3.5 g). High sodium intake and insufficient potassium intake contribute to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke ( 8 , 11) . Reducing salt intake to the recommended level of less than 5 g per day could prevent 1.7 million deaths each year (12) . People are often unaware of the amount of salt they consume. In many countries, most salt comes from pro - cessed foods (e.g. ready meals; processed meats such as bacon, ham and salami; cheese; and salty snacks) or from foods consumed frequently in large amounts (e.g. bread). Salt is also added to foods during cooking (e.g. bouil - lon, stock cubes, soy sauce and fish sauce) or at the point of consumption (e.g. table salt). Salt intake can be reduced by: n limiting the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (e.g. soy sauce, fish sauce and bouillon) when cook - ing and preparing foods; n not having salt or high-sodium sauces on the table; n limiting the consumption of salty snacks; and n choosing products with lower sodium content. Some food manufacturers are reformulating recipes to reduce the sodium content of their products, and people should be encouraged to check nutrition labels to see how much sodium is in a product before purchasing or consuming it. Potassium can mitigate the negative effects of elevated sodium consumption on blood pressure. Intake of potas - sium can be increased by consuming fresh fruit and vegetables. In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7). A reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake would provide additional health benefits (7) . Consuming free sugars increases

Intake of potas - sium can be increased by consuming fresh fruit and vegetables. In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7). A reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake would provide additional health benefits (7) . Consuming free sugars increases the risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Excess calories from foods and drinks high in free sugars also contribute to unhealthy weight gain, which can lead to overweight and obesity. Recent evidence also shows that free sugars influence blood pressure and serum lipids, and suggests that a reduction in free sugars intake reduces risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (13) . Sugars intake can be reduced by: n limiting the consumption of foods and drinks containing high amounts of sugars, such as sugary snacks, candies and sugar-sweetened beverages (i.e. all types of beverages containing free sugars – these include car - bonated or non-carbonated soft drinks, fruit or vegetable juices and drinks, liquid and powder concentrates, flavoured water, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink tea, ready-to-drink coffee and flavoured milk drinks); and n eating fresh fruit and raw vegetables as snacks instead of sugary snacks. HOW TO PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETS Diet evolves over time, being influenced by many social and economic factors that interact in a complex manner to shape individual dietary patterns. These factors include income, food prices (which will affect the availability and affordability of healthy foods), individual preferences and beliefs, cultural traditions, and geographical and environmental aspects (including climate change). Therefore, promoting a healthy food environment – including food systems that promote a diversified, balanced and healthy diet – requires the involvement of multiple sectors and stakeholders, including government, and the public and private sectors. Governments have a central role in creating a healthy food environment that enables people to adopt and main - tain healthy dietary practices. Effective actions by policy-makers to create a healthy food environment include the following: n Creating coherence in national policies and investment plans – including trade, food and agricultural policies – to promote a healthy diet and protect public health through: —increasing incentives for producers and retailers to grow, use and sell fresh fruit and vegetables; —reducing incentives for the food industry

role in creating a healthy food environment that enables people to adopt and main - tain healthy dietary practices. Effective actions by policy-makers to create a healthy food environment include the following: n Creating coherence in national policies and investment plans – including trade, food and agricultural policies – to promote a healthy diet and protect public health through: —increasing incentives for producers and retailers to grow, use and sell fresh fruit and vegetables; —reducing incentives for the food industry to continue or increase production of processed foods contain - ing high levels of saturated fats, trans -fats, free sugars and salt/sodium; —encouraging reformulation of food products to reduce the contents of saturated fats, trans -fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, with the goal of eliminating industrially-produced trans -fats); —implementing the WHO recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children; —establishing standards to foster healthy dietary practices through ensuring the availability of healthy, nutri - tious, safe and affordable foods in pre-schools, schools, other public institutions and the workplace; —exploring regulatory and voluntary instruments (e.g. marketing regulations and nutrition labelling poli - cies), and economic incentives or disincentives (e.g. taxation and subsidies), to promote a healthy diet; and —encouraging transnational, national and local food services and catering outlets to improve the nutritional quality of their foods – ensuring the availability and affordability of healthy choices – and review portion sizes and pricing. Encouraging consumer demand for healthy foods and meals through: —promoting consumer awareness of a healthy diet; —developing school policies and programmes that encourage children to adopt and maintain a healthy diet; —educating children, adolescents and adults about nutrition and healthy dietary practices; —encouraging culinary skills, including in children through schools; —supporting point-of-sale information, including through nutrition labelling that ensures accurate, standard - ized and comprehensible information on nutrient contents in foods (in line with the Codex Alimentarius Commission guidelines), with the addition of front-of-pack labelling to facilitate consumer understanding; and —providing nutrition and dietary counselling at primary health-care facilities. n Promoting appropriate infant and young child feeding practices through: —implementing the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly resolutions; —implementing policies and practices to promote protection of working mothers; and —promoting, protecting and supporting breastfeeding in health services and the community, including through the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative.

WHO RESPONSE The “WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health” (14) was adopted in 2004 by the Health Assembly. The strategy called on governments, WHO, international partners, the private sector and civil society to take action at global, regional and local levels to support healthy diets and physical activity. In 2010, the Health Assembly endorsed a set of recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children (15) . These recommendations guide countries in designing new policies and improving existing ones to reduce the impact on children of the marketing of unhealthy foods. WHO has also developed region-specific tools (such as regional nutrient profile models) that countries can use to implement the market - ing recommendations. In 2012, the Health Assembly adopted a “Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition” and six global nutrition targets to be achieved by 2025, including the reduction of stunting, wasting and overweight in children, the improvement of breastfeeding, and the reduction of anaemia and low birthweight (9) . In 2013, the Health Assembly agreed to nine global voluntary targets for the prevention and control of NCDs. These targets include a halt to the rise in diabetes and obesity, and a 30% relative reduction in the intake of salt by 2025. The “Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013–2020” (10) provides guidance and policy options for Member States, WHO and other United Nations agencies to achieve the targets. With many countries now seeing a rapid rise in obesity among infants and children, in May 2014 WHO set up the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity. In 2016, the Commission proposed a set of recommendations to suc - cessfully tackle childhood and adolescent obesity in different contexts around the world (16) . November 2014, WHO organized, jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2). ICN2 adopted the Rome Declaration on Nutri - tion (17), and the Framework

in obesity among infants and children, in May 2014 WHO set up the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity. In 2016, the Commission proposed a set of recommendations to suc - cessfully tackle childhood and adolescent obesity in different contexts around the world (16) . November 2014, WHO organized, jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2). ICN2 adopted the Rome Declaration on Nutri - tion (17), and the Framework for Action (18) which recommends a set of policy options and strategies to promote diversified, safe and healthy diets at all stages of life. WHO is helping countries to implement the commitments made at ICN2. In May 2018, the Health Assembly approved the 13th General Programme of Work (GPW13), which will guide the work of WHO in 2019–2023 (19) . Reduction of salt/sodium intake and elimination of industrially-produced trans -fats from the food supply are identified in GPW13 as part of WHO’s priority actions to achieve the aims of ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. To support Member States in taking necessary actions to eliminate industrially-produced trans -fats, WHO has developed a roadmap for countries (the REPLACE action package) to help accelerate actions (6) .

Some women may get just a feel ing of heaviness in the abdomen or tugging in the pelvic area. Other women experience sever e cramps differ en t from preme nstrual syndrome (PMS) pain. A majority of per iod pain can be relieved by over-the-counter nonster oidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen, ibuprofen, or aspirin. Starting an over-the-counter NSAID med icine when your per iod ﬁrst starts may also lessen heavy me nstrual bleeding and help control the pain better. Ther e are two types of dysmenorrhea: Primary dysmenorrh ea. This is the most common type of dysmeno rrhea. The pain is usually caused by contractions of the uter us (womb). The uter us contracts during your per iod to help the uter ine lining leave the body. Teen s may get dysmeno rrhea soon after they get their ﬁrst per iod. For mo st women, primary dysmeno rrhea gets less painful as they get older. But some women get sever e men strual pain. Your risk for dysmeno rrhea may be higher if you: Got your ﬁrst per iod before age 11 Have longer or heavier per iods Smoke Have high levels of stress Secondary dysmenorrh ea. This type of dysmeno rrhea is usually caused by another health problem. Pain from secondary dysmeno rrhea usually gets worse as you get older. It also lasts longer than normal men strual cramp s. Problems that cause sec ondary dysmeno rrhea include: Endometriosis. This condition happen s when the lining of the uter us grows outside of the uterus wher e it does not belong. In response to monthly changes in levels of the hormo ne estrogen, this lining breaks down and bleed s outside of the uter us and can cause swelling and pain. Uterine ﬁbroids.

Cysts are ﬂuid-ﬁlled sacs on the ovary. Ovarian cysts usually don’t cause any symp toms, but some can cause pain during your per iod or at ovulation. When to see your doctor Talk to your doctor or nurse if over-the-counter pain medicine, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, does not help or if the pain interferes with daily activities like work or school. Your doctor or nurse will ask you questions and do some tests, including possibly a physical exam, to rule out any other health problem . Keep ing track of your symptoms and per iods in a diary or calend ar can help your doctor or nurse diagnose any health problem s. See your doctor to rule out other health problems if: You have blood clots in your menstrual ﬂow that are larger than a quarter. Your pain happen s at times other than just before your period or during your per iod. Treatmen t dep end s on what is causing your pain. Your doctor may prescribe hormonal birth control, such as a hormonal intrauterine device (IUD ), the pill, shot, or vaginal ring, to help with pain from end ometriosis, ﬁbroids, or ovarian cysts. Hormonal birth control is sometimes prescribed by doctors for wome n’s health concerns other than preven ting pregnancy.

Your per iods can also be irregular if your cycle leng th varies by more than 20 days from month to month. An example would be your cycle jumping from a normal 25-day cycle to a 46-day cycle the next month and then back to a 25-day cycle the following month. Irregular per iods are normal for teen age girls and per imeno pausal women. Teen girls’ per iods may be irregular for the ﬁrst few years before bec oming more regular. During the transition to meno pause, called per imeno pause, men strual cycles may become more irregular over time. Causes of irregular per iods include: Eating disorders. Irregular or missed per iods can be signs of eating disorder s, most often anorexia ner vosa. But any eating disorder, including bulimia ner vosa and binge eating disorder, can cause irregular per iods. Thyroid problems, such as hyper thyroidism (hy-pur-THY-roi-diz- uhm). Hyper thyroidism, or overactive thyroid, causes your thyroid to make more thyroid hormone than your body need s. Hyperthyroidism can also cause fewer and lighter me nstrual per iods than normal. High am ounts of prolac tin in the blood. This condition is called hyper prolactinem ia (hy-pur-pro-LAK-te-nee -me-uh). Prolactin is the hormone that causes breasts to grow during puberty and makes breastmilk after childbirth. It also helps control the men strual cycle.

PID is most often caused by a sexually transmitted infec tion (STI). Stress. Studies show high levels of chronic (long-term) stress can lead to irregular per iods. Uncontrolled diab etes. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes can cause irregular per iods, but getting your diabetes under control can help your per iods bec ome more regular. Obesity. The extra fat in the body makes the hormone estrogen. The extra estrogen changes the normal me nstrual cycle and can cause missed , irregular, or heavy periods. When to call the doctor You get irregular per iods after having normal cycles. Your per iod happen s more often than every 24 days or less often than ever y 38 days.

If you have heavy bleed ing, your per iods may be so painful and heavy that you ﬁnd it hard to do normal activities such as going to work or school. Causes of heavy bleed ing include: Problems with ovulation. In a normal men strual cycle, your uterine lining builds up and thicken s to prepare for pregnancy. If pregnancy11 12 8 9 Period problem: Heavy bleeding+ 131/13/26, 12:16 AM Period problems 5/12 does not happen, the uter ine lining leaves your body during your per iod. If your hormones get out of balance or if you do not ovulate, the uter ine lining can build up too much and bleed heavily and in an unpred ictable patter n. Problems with the uterine lining. If your hormones or uter ine lining get out of balance, the uter ine lining can bleed too mu ch. This can cause heavy bleed ing as the lining is pushed out during the next men strual per iod. Thyroid problems. Heavy bleed ing can be a sign of hypothyroidism (hy-poh-THY-roi-diz-uhm), or under active thyroid. Hypothyroidism happen s when your thyroid does not make enough thyroid hormones. Uterine ﬁbroids. Fibroids are made of muscle tissue that grows in or on the wall of the uter us. They are almo st always not cancer. They can cause pain and heavy or irregular bleed ing. Uterine polyp s. Polyps are an over growth of the endometrial tissue that lines the inside of the uterine wall. They are usually small. They are usually not cancer but can cause heavy or long per iods. Certain medicines. Some med icines, such as blood thinner s, can cause heavy or long per iods. Pregnan cy problems. Unus ual or not regular heavy bleed ing can be caused by a miscarriage (an early pregnancy that ends) or an ec topic pregnancy. An ec topic pregnancy is when the fertilized egg implants outside of the uter us (womb ) wher e it does not belong, putting a woman’s life in danger. Ectopic pregnancies can never end in a healthy pregnancy and are a med ical emer gency. Bleeding disorders.

Ectopic pregnancies can never end in a healthy pregnancy and are a med ical emer gency. Bleeding disorders. Hem ophilia and von W illeb rand’s disease are inher ited bleed ing disorder s that cause heavy bleed ing during per iods. Studies show that up to one in ﬁve white women with heavy per iods has a bleed ing disorder. Bleed ing disorder s are less common in African-Amer ican women, affecting about one in 20 African- Amer ican women with heavy bleed ing. For many women, heavy men strual bleed ing is the only sign they have a bleed ing disorder. Obesity. The extra fat in the body makes the hormone estrogen. The extra estrogen changes the normal me nstrual cycle and can cause missed , irregular, or heavy periods.141/13/26, 12:16 AM Period problems 6/12 Some research has found that wome n with myalgic enc ep halomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) have a higher risk for heavy bleed ing. Women with ME/CFS may experience a range of symptoms that can include fatigue (tired ness or exhaustion that does not get better with rest and sleep ), muscle and joint pain, and memory problem s. When to call the doctor Your per iod lasts longer than eight days. You bleed through one or more pads or tamp ons every one to two hours. You feel dizzy, lightheaded , weak, or tired, or if you have chest pain or trouble breathing during or after your period. These can be symptoms of anem ia. Anem ia is a condition that happen s when your blood cannot carry eno ugh oxygen to your body bec ause of a lack of iron. You pass men strual blood clots larger than the size of quarters. (It is normal to pass clots the size of quarters or smaller.) Your doctor or nurse may try treating heavy bleeding ﬁrst with hormonal birth control, such as a hormonal IUD, the pill, shot, or vaginal ring. Hormonal birth control is some time s prescribed by doctors for women ’s health concer ns other than preventing pregnancy.

If birth control or other med icines do not help, you may need surgery to treat the cause of heavy bleed ing. Surger y for heavy bleed ing is usually the last treatmen t option women and their doctors consider because surger y always has risks.15 8 9 Period problem: Unusual (abnormal) bleeding+1/13/26, 12:16 AM Period problems 7/12 Unus ual or abnormal bleed ing is any bleed ing that is different from your typical men strual per iod or happens when you do not have your period. Causes of unusual bleed ing include: Horm onal chan ges. Changing hormone levels during puberty and per imeno pause, the transition to meno pause, can cause longer, heavier per iods. They can also cause irregular cycles. Endometriosis. This condition happen s when the lining of the uter us grows outside of the uter us wher e it does not belong. Ovari an cysts. Unus ual bleed ing may be a sign of an ovarian cyst that has ruptured (burst). Can cer, such as uterine, cervical, an d ovari an can cer. Any vaginal bleed ing after meno pause can be a sign of a ser ious health problem, including ovarian, cer vical or uterine cancer.

Ameno rrhea that is not caused by pregnancy or breastfeed ing could mean that your ovaries stopped making normal amounts of the hormone estrogen. Missing this hormone can have ser ious effec ts on your health. Causes of ameno rrhea include: Pregnan cy. Your per iod stops during pregnancy bec ause your ovaries no longer release eggs. You may get some spotting (light vaginal bleed ing), but this is commo n and usually does not mean a problem with the pregnancy. If you have spotting during pregnancy you should see your doctor or nurse to be sure. Learn more in our Pregnancy sec tion. Breastfeeding.

For most women this happens around every 28 days, but it's common for periods to be more or less frequent than this, ranging from every 21 days to every 35 days. Your period can last between 2 and 7 days, but it will usually last for about 5 days. The bleeding tends to be heaviest in the first 2 days. When your period is at its heaviest, the blood will be red. On lighter days, it may be pink or brown. You'll lose about 20 to 90ml (about 1 to 5 tablespoons) of blood during your period, although some women bleed more heavily than this.

When do periods start? Periods usually begin at around the age of 12, although some girls will start them earlier or later. A delay in starting periods (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/periods/starting-periods/) isn't usually a cause for concern. Most girls will be having regular periods by age 16 to 18. Read more about early or delayed puberty (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/early-or-delayed-puberty/). Period products Period products soak up or collect the blood released during your period. The main types of period products are: pads tampons menstrual cups Pads Pads are strips of padding that have a sticky side you attach to your underwear to hold them in place. One side of the pad is made of an absorbent material that soaks up the blood. Pads come in many sizes, so you can choose one to suit how heavy or light your period is. You can also get reusable washable pads. Pantyliners are a smaller and thinner type of pad that can be used on days when your period is very light. Tampons Tampons are small tubes of cotton wool that you insert into your vagina to soak up the blood before it comes out of your body. There are 2 types of tampon – ones that come with an applicator and others without an applicator that you insert with your fingers. In both cases, there's a string at one end of the tampon, which you pull to remove it. Tampons come with instructions that explain

There are 2 types of tampon – ones that come with an applicator and others without an applicator that you insert with your fingers. In both cases, there's a string at one end of the tampon, which you pull to remove it. Tampons come with instructions that explain how to use them. If the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not be able to feel it inside you. If you can feel it or it hurts, it might not be in properly. It is not possible for a tampon to get lost inside you. Your vagina holds it firmly in place and it expands inside you as it soaks up the blood. Menstrual cups Menstrual cups are an alternative to pads and tampons. The cup is made from silicone and you put it inside your vagina.Health A to Z (Link: www.nhs.uk/health-a-to-z/) NHS services (Link: www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/) Live Well (Link: www.nhs.uk/live-well/) Overview Starting your periods (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/periods/starting-periods/) Period problems (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/periods/period-problems/)1/13/26, 12:13 AM Periods - NHS 1/3 Menstrual cups collect the blood rather than absorb it. Unlike tampons and most pads, which are thrown away after they've been used, you can wash menstrual cups and use them again. Period underwear Period underwear are pants made from absorbent fabric. They soak up blood in the same way as pads, and have a layer to prevent leaks. They're designed to be washed and reused. PMS (premenstrual syndrome) Changes in your body's hormone levels before your period can cause physical and emotional changes. This is known as PMS (premenstrual syndrome) (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-menstrual-syndro me/) or PMT (premenstrual tension). There are many possible symptoms of PMS, but typical symptoms include: feeling bloated breast tenderness mood swings feeling irritable spotty skin low sex drive (loss of libido) (Link: www.nhs.uk/symptoms/loss-of-libido/) headaches These symptoms usually improve when your period starts and disappear a few days afterwards.

Changes in your periods Your periods can change – for example, they may last longer or get lighter. This does not necessarily mean there's a problem, but it does need to be investigated. You can see your GP, or visit your nearest women's clinic or contraceptive clinic (Link: www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/sexual- health-services/find-contraception-services/). Bleeding between periods (Link: www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/sexual-health/what-causes-bleeding-between- periods/), bleeding after having sex, or bleeding after the menopause (Link: www.nhs.uk/symptoms/post-menopausal- bleeding/) needs to be checked by a doctor. It might be caused by an infection, abnormalities in the neck of the womb (the cervix) or, in rare cases, it could be cancer (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/cancer/). You could be pregnant if you miss a period and you've had sex. See your GP if you've taken a pregnancy test (Link: www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/trying-for-a-baby/doing-a-pregnancy-test/) and the result is negative (you're not pregnant) and you've missed 3 consecutive periods.

April 1, 2022 While your middle school sex education might have taught you that a period comes every 28 days, you’ve likely noticed that periods vary widely from person to person — and they can vary quite a bit for each individual person as well. With all this variation, how do you know if your period is “abnorm al” — and potentially signaling that something is wrong? Having atypical periods is known as abnormal uterine bleeding, or AUB. What exactly constitutes “normal” and “abnormal” has long been confusing, even for health care providers. Adding to the confusion, the terminology for AUB historically included complex words like “menorrhagia” (heavy bleeding) and “oligomenorrhea” (infrequent periods).

What exactly constitutes “normal” and “abnormal” has long been confusing, even for health care providers. Adding to the confusion, the terminology for AUB historically included complex words like “menorrhagia” (heavy bleeding) and “oligomenorrhea” (infrequent periods). The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) has established criteria to help more clearly determine what qualiﬁes as AUB. These updated deﬁnitions of normal and abnormal uterine bleeding are much more user-friendly than what were available in the past. Hopefully, these clariﬁcations make it much easier for people to understand what’s going on in their own bodies. An im portant note: If one cycle is a little delayed or you bleed a bit longer than you are used to, there probably is little reason to worry (but don’t forget to check for pregnancy!). When you notice a pattern of bleeding changes, you should probably review this with your health care team. Is your period norm al?Save Content Feedback1/13/26, 12:14 AM Is my period "normal"? Is it OK if it's not? - Mayo Clinic Press 1/6 To determine whether your period is considered typical, consider the following questions. The FIGO criteria uses the terms “normal” and “abnormal,” so we’ll also use those terms for consistency. H ow often do you get your period? Norm al: Every 24 to 38 days Abnorm al: Less than every 24 days, more than every 38 days or no bleeding at all The frequency of your period is calculated from the ﬁrst day of one period to the ﬁrst day of the next period. If this is less than 24 days, you have frequent periods. If this is more than 38 days, you have infrequent periods. If you’re not experiencing any bleeding at all, this also is abnormal. H ow long is your period? Norm al: 8 days or less Abnorm al: More than 8 days The length of your period is the time from the ﬁrst day of the period until bleeding stops. This used to be a very gray area with no strict deﬁnitions. But now, if you bleed for more than 8 days, that is considered a prolonged period. H ow predi ctable is your period?

This used to be a very gray area with no strict deﬁnitions. But now, if you bleed for more than 8 days, that is considered a prolonged period. H ow predi ctable is your period? Norm al: The length of your cycle varies at most by 7 to 9 days If you are 18 to 25, the length of your cycle should vary at most by 9 days. If you are 26 to 41, the length of your cycle should vary at most by 7 days. If you are 42 to 45, the length of your cycle should vary at most by 9 days. Abnorm al: The length of your cycle varies by 8 to 10 days or more For example, if you have a cycle that’s 24 days, and the next cycle is 30 days, that’s still normal because that’s only a deviation of 6 days. H ow heavy is your period? Discover more Women's Health content from articles, podcasts, to videos. Norm al: A period that seems “normal” Abnorm al: A period that seems “light” or “heavy” This used to be very difficult to accurately assess because it was based on actual milliliters of blood loss. Well, who actually measures blood loss? Now it’s very subjective and based on your interpretation of the amount of bleeding. By deﬁnition, heavy means the amount of bleeding is interfering with someone’s quality of life. This might mean leaking through tampons or pads — or having to change them frequently. What one person considers heavy, another person might consider typical. D o you have bleedi ng betw een periods?

If you experience this, your provider would want to determine whether it’s happening at the same time each cycle, seems to be related to intercourse or is unpredictable. Some people regularly experience spotting midcycle around the time of egg release (ovulation), and while that’s not necessarily worrisome, it is not considered typical. So your period is outside the typical range — now w hat? If you fall into any of the abnormal categories — whether that’s based on how long, predictable, heavy or frequent your periods are — you are considered to have AUB. It’s worth having a conversation with a health care professional about any atypical bleeding. That conversation can be with your primary care provider; it doesn’t need to be an OB/GYN — but you should talk about it with someone. Yes, there are a lot of noncancerous (benign) reasons for AUB. But there are also some conditions that should be addressed and evaluated to make sure that there isn’t a bigger problem going on. Possible reasons for AUB include: Small benign growths on the lining of the uterus (uterine polyps) Contraception such as an intrauterine device (IUD) or birth control pills A hormone imbalance, which could be caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obesity or thyroid problems Noncancerous tumors of the uterus (uterine ﬁbroids) Inherited bleeding disorders Cancer of the cervix or uterus A health care professional can help determine whether any of these are responsible for your bleeding — and if necessary, offer treatment. W hat if you’ve already gone through m enopaus e or are in perim enopaus e? People who have gone an entire year without a period are considered to be postmenopausal. And in that case, any bleeding should not be ignored — they should seek care promptly, because bleeding could potentially be a sign of precancerous changes or cancer. In perimenopause — the transition to menopause — periods should become lighter and less frequent. If they’re becoming heavier and more frequent, this may warrant evaluation and should be discussed with your health care team to make sure that there isn’t anything harmful going on.

But if it’s becoming a persistent issue, I’d want to investigate and make sure that there isn’t anything more serious going on. But the level of concern also depends on other factors, like your stage of life. Again, if you’re postmenopausal and haven’t had any bleeding in 5 years and start spotting, a provider should evaluate that right away.

Regular practice will help you improve. Build up your activity level slowly to help you continue to get stronger , faster , or more flexible without pushing too hard all at once. Challenge yourself by lifting slightly heavier weights, adding a few more minutes to your walk, or increasing your pace. Mix up your workouts to keep things interesting and help prevent injuries or burnout. Show up regularly , even for short sessions, to help you continue to make progress. What are the different types of exercise? There are many dif ferent types of exercise. Before you start, check with your health care provider , especially if you have trouble moving, balancing, or worry that exercise might not be safe for you.

ferent types of exercise. Before you start, check with your health care provider , especially if you have trouble moving, balancing, or worry that exercise might not be safe for you. A few main types of exercise include: Aerobic exercises such as walking, running, or swimming are sometimes referred to as cardio. This is short for cardiovascular exercise. These exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy and improve your overall fitness. Strength, or resistance training, exercises use weights, resistance bands, or your own body weight to build stronger muscles. Balance exercises, such as tai chi or standing on one leg, improve your stability and coordination. They may make it easier for you to walk on uneven surfaces and help prevent falls [ . Flexibility exercises, such as stretching or yoga, help your joints move more easily and improve your posture. Most people benefit from a combination of these types of exercises. Your provider can help you choose the best type or amount of activity for you based on your fitness level and health. How can I fit exercise into my day?

It's a normal and healthy reaction to change or a challenge. But stress that goes on for more than a few weeks can affect your health. Keep stress from making you sick by learning healthy ways to manage it. Information LEARN TO RECOGNIZE STRESS The first step in managing stress is recognizing it in your life. Everyone feels stress in a different way. You may get angry or irritable, lose sleep, or have headaches or an upset stomach. What are your signs of stress? Once you know what signals to look for, you can start to manage it. Also identify the situations that cause you stress. These are called stressors. Your stressors could be family, school, work, relationships, money, or health problems. Once you understand where your stress is coming from, you can come up with ways to deal with your stressors. AVOID UNHEALTHY STRESS RELIEF When you feel stressed, you may fall back on unhealthy behaviors to help you relax. These may include: Eating too much Smoking cigarettes Drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs Sleeping too much or not sleeping enough These behaviors may help you feel better at first, but they may hurt you more than they help. Instead, use the tips below to find healthy ways to reduce your stress. FIND HEALTHY STRESS BUSTERS There are many healthy ways to manage stress. Try a few and see which ones work best for you.

let go and not get upset. For instance, you cannot change the fact that you have to drive during rush hour. But you can look for ways to relax during your commute, such as listening to a podcast or book. Avoid stressful situations. When you can, remove yourself from the source of stress. For example, if your family squabbles during the holidays, give yourself a breather and go out for a walk or drive. Get exercise. Getting physical activity every day is one of the easiest and best ways to cope with stress. When you exercise, your brain releases chemicals that make you feel good. It can also help you release built-up energy or frustration. Find something you enjoy, whether it is walking, cycling, softball, swimming, or dancing, and do it for at least 30 minutes on most days. Change your outlook. Try to develop a more positive attitude toward challenges. You can do this by replacing negative thoughts with more positive ones. For example, rather than thinking, "Why does everything always go wrong?" change this thought to, "I can find a way to get through this." It may seem hard or silly at first, but with practice, you may find it helps turn your outlook around. Do something you enjoy. When stress has you down, do something you enjoy to help pick you up. It could be as simple as reading a good book, listening to music, watching a favorite movie, or having dinner with a friend. Or, take up a new hobby or class. Whatever you choose, try to do at least one thing a day that's just for you. Learn new ways to relax. Practicing relaxation techniques is a great way to handle daily stress. Relaxation techniques help slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure. There are many types, from deep breathing and meditation to yoga and tai chi. Take a class, or try learning from books, videos, or online sources. Connect with loved ones. Do not let stress get in the way of being social. Spending time with family and friends can help you feel better and forget about your stress. Confiding in a friend may also help you work out your problems. Get enough sleep. Getting a good night's sleep can help you think more clearly and have more energy. This will make it easier to handle any problems that crop up. Aim

Getting a good night's sleep can help you think more clearly and have more energy. This will make it easier to handle any problems that crop up. Aim for about 7 to 9 hours each night.

If your stress comes from taking on too much at home or work, learn to set limits. Ask others for help when you need it. RESOURCES If you can't manage stress on your own, you may want to talk with your health care provider. Or consider seeing a therapist or counselor who can help you find other ways to deal with your stress. Depending on the cause of your stress, you also may find it helps to join a support group.
