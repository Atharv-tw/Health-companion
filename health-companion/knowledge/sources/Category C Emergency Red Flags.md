Home → Medical Encyclopedia → Anaphylaxis URL of this page: //medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000844.htm Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening type of allergic reaction. Causes Anaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that has become an allergen. An allergen is a substance that, for most people, is harmless, but in some people, it can cause an allergic reaction. After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. When the person is exposed to that allergen again, an allergic reaction may occur. Anaphylaxis usually happens quickly after the exposure. The condition is severe and involves the whole body. Tissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms. Some medicines (morphine, x-ray dye, aspirin, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (often called an anaphylactoid reaction) when people are ﬁrst exposed to them. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with true anaphylaxis. But, the symptoms, risk of complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions. Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include: Medicine allergies Food allergies Insect bites/stings Pollen and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some people have an anaphylactic reaction with no known cause. An official website of the United States governmentHere’s how you know National Institutes of Health /National Library of Medicine Anaphylaxis is life threatening and can occur at any time. Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction. Symptoms Symptoms develop quickly, often within seconds or minutes. They may include any of the following: Abdominal pain Feeling anxious Chest discomfort or tightness Diarrhea Diﬃculty breathing, coughing, wheezing, or high-pitched breathing sounds Diﬃculty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Hives, itchiness, redness of the skin Nasal congestion Nausea or vomiting Palpitations Slurred speech Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine the person and ask about what might have caused the condition. Tests for the allergen that caused anaphylaxis (if the cause is not obvious) may be done after treatment. Treatment Anaphylaxis is an emergency condition that needs medical attention right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number immediately. Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation, which are known as the ABC's of Basic Life Support. A warning sign of dangerous

Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine the person and ask about what might have caused the condition. Tests for the allergen that caused anaphylaxis (if the cause is not obvious) may be done after treatment. Treatment Anaphylaxis is an emergency condition that needs medical attention right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number immediately. Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation, which are known as the ABC's of Basic Life Support. A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR. 1. Call 911 or the local emergency number. 2. Calm and reassure the person. 3. If the allergic reaction is from a bee sting, scrape the stinger off the skin with something ﬁrm (such as a ﬁngernail or plastic credit card). Do not use tweezers. Squeezing the stinger will release more venom. 4. If the person has emergency allergy medicine on hand, help them take or inject it. Do not give medicine by the mouth if the person is having diﬃculty breathing. An epinephrine injector should be used immediately if it is available. 5. Take steps to prevent shock. Have the person lie ﬂat, raise the person's feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters), and cover the person with a coat or blanket. Do not place the person in this position if a head, neck, back, or leg injury is suspected, or if it causes discomfort. DO NOT: Do not assume that any allergy shots the person has already received will provide complete protection. Do not place a pillow under the person's head if they are having trouble breathing. This can block the airways. Do not give the person anything by mouth if they are having trouble breathing. Paramedics or other providers may place a tube through the nose or mouth into the airways. Or emergency surgery will be done to place a tube directly into the trachea. The person may receive medicines to further reduce symptoms. Outlook (Prognosis) Anaphylaxis can be life threatening without prompt treatment. Symptoms usually do get better with the right therapy, so it is important to act right away. Possible Complications Without prompt treatment, anaphylaxis may result in: Blocked airway Cardiac arrest (no effective heartbeat) Respiratory arrest (no breathing) Shock Death When to Contact a Medical Professional Call 911 or

emergency surgery will be done to place a tube directly into the trachea. The person may receive medicines to further reduce symptoms. Outlook (Prognosis) Anaphylaxis can be life threatening without prompt treatment. Symptoms usually do get better with the right therapy, so it is important to act right away. Possible Complications Without prompt treatment, anaphylaxis may result in: Blocked airway Cardiac arrest (no effective heartbeat) Respiratory arrest (no breathing) Shock Death When to Contact a Medical Professional Call 911 or the local emergency number if you or someone you know develops severe symptoms of anaphylaxis. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. Prevention To prevent allergic reactions and anaphylaxis: Avoid triggers such as foods and medicines that have caused an allergic reaction in the past. Ask detailed questions about ingredients when you are eating away from home. Also carefully examine ingredient labels. If you have a child who is allergic to certain foods, introduce one new food at a time in small amounts so you can recognize an allergic reaction. People who know that they have had serious allergic reactions should wear a medical ID tag or bracelet. If you have a history of serious allergic reactions, carry injectable epinephrine according to your provider's instructions. There is no contraindication to using epinephrine in a severe allergic reaction.

National Library of Medicine8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20894U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health About Heart Attack Symptoms, Risk, and Recovery KEY POINTS A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn’t get enough blood. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main cause of heart attack. What it is A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart muscle. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main cause of heart attack. A less common cause is a severe spasm, or sudden contraction, of a coronary artery that can stop blood flow to the heart muscle. Symptoms Know the heart attack signs for men and women.For Everyone OCTOBER 24, 2024 Heart Disease The major symptoms of a heart attack are: Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. Feeling weak, light-headed, or faint. You may also break into a cold sweat. Pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back. Pain or discomfort in one or both arms or shoulders. Shortness of breath. This often comes along with chest discomfort, but shortness of breath also can happen before chest discomfort. Other symptoms of a heart attack could include unusual or unexplained tiredness and nausea or vomiting. Women are more likely to have these other symptoms. Learn more about women and heart disease. Call 9-1-1 if you notice symptoms of a heart attack

or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back. Pain or discomfort in one or both arms or shoulders. Shortness of breath. This often comes along with chest discomfort, but shortness of breath also can happen before chest discomfort. Other symptoms of a heart attack could include unusual or unexplained tiredness and nausea or vomiting. Women are more likely to have these other symptoms. Learn more about women and heart disease. Call 9-1-1 if you notice symptoms of a heart attack If you notice the symptoms of a heart attack in yourself or someone else, call 9-1-1 immediately. The sooner you get to an emergency room, the sooner you can get treatment to reduce the amount of damage to the heart muscle. At the hospital, health care professionals can run tests to find out if a heart attack is happening and can decide the best treatment. In some cases, a heart attack requires cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or an electrical shock (defibrillation) to the heart to get the heart pumping again. Bystanders trained to use CPR or a defibrillator may be able to help until emergency medical personnel arrive. Remember, the chances of surviving a heart attack are better the sooner emergency treatment begins. Risk factors Several health conditions, your lifestyle, and your age and family history can increase your risk for heart disease and heart attack. These are called risk factors. In addition, about half of all Americans have at least one of these three key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking. Some risk factors cannot be controlled, such as your age or family history. But you can take steps to lower your risk by changing the factors you can control. Learn more about risk factors for heart disease and heart attack. What to do to recover after a heart attack If you've had a heart attack, your heart may be damaged. This could affect your heart's rhythm and its ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. You may also be at risk for another heart attack or conditions such as stroke, kidney disorders, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). You can lower your chances of having future health problems following a heart attack with these steps: Physical activity: Talk with your health care team about the things you do each day in your life and work.

affect your heart's rhythm and its ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. You may also be at risk for another heart attack or conditions such as stroke, kidney disorders, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). You can lower your chances of having future health problems following a heart attack with these steps: Physical activity: Talk with your health care team about the things you do each day in your life and work. Your doctor may want you to limit work, travel, or sexual activity for some time after a heart attack. Lifestyle changes: Eating a healthier diet, increasing physical activity, quitting smoking, and managing stress—in addition to taking prescribed medicines—can help improve your heart health and quality of life. Ask your health care team about attending a program called cardiac rehabilitation to help you make these lifestyle changes. Cardiac rehabilitation: Cardiac rehabilitation is an important program for anyone recovering from a heart attack, heart failure, or other heart problem that required surgery or medical care. Cardiac rehab is a supervised program that includes: Physical activity. Education about healthy living, including healthy eating, taking medicine as prescribed, and ways to help you quit smoking. Counseling to find ways to relieve stress and improve mental health. A team of people may help you through cardiac rehab, including your health care team, exercise and nutrition specialists, physical therapists, and counselors or mental health professionals.[1] Resources National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Heart Attack  SOURCES REFERENCES 1.

The faster you act, the better their chances. Symptoms of a heart attack Symptoms of a heart attack can include: chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy feeling lightheaded or dizzy sweating shortness of breath feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack) coughing or wheezing The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion. While the most common symptom is chest pain, symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain without any chest pain. Waiting for an ambulance If you have had a heart attack, it's important that you rest while you wait for an ambulance, to avoid unnecessary strain on your heart. If aspirin is available and you are not allergic to it, slowly chew and then swallow an adult-size tablet (300mg) while you wait for the ambulance. Aspirin helps to thin your blood and improve blood flow to your heart.Health A to Z (Link: www.nhs.uk/health-a-to-z/) NHS services (Link: www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/) Overview (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/) Symptoms Causes (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/causes/) Diagnosis (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/diagnosis/) Treatment (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/treatment/) Recovery (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/recovery/) Complications (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/complications/) Prevention (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/prevention/)More Cardiac arrest In some cases, a complication called ventricular arrhythmia can cause the heart to stop beating.

If there is someone with you, ask them to find an automated external defibrillator (AED) and use it as soon as you can. Hands-only CPR (chest compressions) To do chest compressions on an adult: 1. Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person's chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and interlock your fingers. 2. Using your body weight (not just your arms), press straight down by 5 to 6cm on their chest. 3. Repeat this until an ambulance arrives. Aim to do 100 to 120 compressions a minute. Find out about how to resuscitate a child (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/resuscitating-a- baby/). Automated external defibrillator (AED) If you have access to an AED, you should use it. An AED is a safe, portable electrical device that most large organisations keep as part of first aid equipment. It helps to establish a regular heartbeat during a cardiac arrest by monitoring the person's heartbeat and giving them an electric shock if necessary. Find out more about automated external defibrillators (AED) on the Arrhythmia Alliance website (Link: defibrillators) Angina and heart attacks Angina (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/) is chest pain caused by the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart becoming restricted. People with angina can experience similar symptoms to a heart attack, but they usually happen during exercise and pass within a few minutes. However, occasionally, people with angina can have a heart attack. It's important to recognise the difference between the symptoms of angina and those of a heart attack. Symptoms of angina can be controlled with a medicine called glyceryl trinitrate that's prescribed for people who have angina. The medicine should improve the symptoms within 5 minutes. If you're having a heart attack, the medicine will not work. If the first dose of glyceryl trinitrate you take does not work after 5 minutes, take a second dose. If the second dose does not work after 5 minutes, call 999. Call 999 sooner if the pain gets worse or you also feel unwell, sick, dizzy or short of breath.

They may include: face weakness – one side of your face may droop (fall) and it might be hard to smile arm weakness – you may not be able to fully lift both arms and keep them there because of weakness or numbness in 1 arm speech problems – you may slur your words or sound confused The easiest way to remember these symptoms is the word FAST. This stands for: face, arms, speech and time to call 999. Other symptoms of a stroke There are other signs that you or someone else is having a stroke. These include: weakness or numbness down 1 side of your body blurred vision or loss of sight in 1 or both eyes finding it difficult to speak or think of words confusion and memory loss feeling dizzy or falling over a severe headache feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting) Symptoms of a stroke can sometimes stop after a short time, so you may think you're OK.

A stroke is sometimes called a "brain attack." If blood ﬂow is cut off for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get nutrients and oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing lasting damage. A stroke can also occur if a blood vessel inside the brain bursts, leading to bleeding inside the head. Causes There are two major types of stroke: Ischemic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways: A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke. A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke. Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries. Watch this video about: Stroke A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include: An official website of the United States governmentHere’s how you know National Institutes of Health /National Library of Medicine Aneurysm (weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out) Arteriovenous malformation (AVM; abnormal connection between the arteries and veins) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; condition in which proteins called amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain) Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and warfarin or has a bleeding disorder.

Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke. High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes. Other major risk factors are: Irregular heartbeat, called atrial ﬁbrillation Diabetes Smoking Family history of stroke Being male High cholesterol Increasing age, especially after age 55 Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke) Obesity History of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (occurs when blood ﬂow to a part of the brain stops for a brief time) Stroke risk is also higher in: People who have heart disease or poor blood ﬂow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as excessive use of alcohol, use of recreational drugs, a high-fat diet, or lack of exercise People who have a hereditary tendency to develop blood clots Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are older than 35) Women who are pregnant Women who take hormone replacement therapy Patent foramen ovale (PFO), a hole between the left and right atria (upper chambers) of the heart People who have sleep disorders (such as obstructive sleep apnea) Symptoms Symptoms of stroke depend on which part of the brain is damaged. In some cases, a person may not know that a stroke has occurred. Most of the time, symptoms develop suddenly and without warning. But symptoms may occur on and off for the ﬁrst day or two. Symptoms are usually most severe when the stroke ﬁrst happens, but they may slowly get worse. A headache may occur if the stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. The headache: Starts suddenly and may be severe May be worse when you are lying ﬂat May wake you up from sleep May get worse when you change positions or when you bend, strain, or cough Other symptoms depend on

occur on and off for the ﬁrst day or two. Symptoms are usually most severe when the stroke ﬁrst happens, but they may slowly get worse. A headache may occur if the stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. The headache: Starts suddenly and may be severe May be worse when you are lying ﬂat May wake you up from sleep May get worse when you change positions or when you bend, strain, or cough Other symptoms depend on how severe the stroke is, and what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms may include: Change in alertness (including sleepiness, unconsciousness, and coma) Changes in hearing or taste Changes that affect touch and the ability to feel pain, pressure, or different temperatures Confusion or loss of memory Problems swallowing Problems writing or reading Dizziness or abnormal feeling of movement (vertigo) Eyesight problems, such as decreased vision, double vision, or total loss of vision Lack of control over the bladder or bowels Loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking Muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg (usually just on one side) Numbness or tingling on one side of the body Personality, mood, or emotional changes Trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking Exams and Tests Your health care provider will do a physical exam to: Check for problems with vision, movement, feeling, reﬂexes, understanding, and speaking. Your provider and nurses will repeat this exam over time to see if your stroke is getting worse or improving. Listen to the carotid arteries in the neck with a stethoscope for an abnormal sound, called a bruit, which is caused by abnormal blood ﬂow. Check for high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. You may have the following tests to help ﬁnd the type, location, and cause of the stroke and check for other problems: CT scan or MRI scan of the brain to determine the location of the stroke, and if there is a mass, or any bleeding Angiogram of the head to look for a blood vessel that is blocked or bleeding Carotid duplex (ultrasound) to see if the carotid arteries in your neck have narrowed Echocardiogram to see if the stroke could have been caused by a blood clot from the heart Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CT angiography to check for abnormal blood vessels in the brain Other tests include: Blood tests Electroencephalogram (EEG) to determine

Quick treatment is needed. Call 911 or the local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the ﬁrst signs of a stroke. People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible. If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting medicine may be given to dissolve the clot (also called thrombolytic therapy). To be effective, this treatment must be started within 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms ﬁrst started. However, the sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome. Endovascular thrombectomy may be needed. This is when a catheter is inserted into your arteries. Dye is injected while images of your brain's blood vessels are reviewed. A clot, if found, could be removed through the catheter. Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include: Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin, direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix) Medicine to control risk factors for stroke, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes Nutrients and ﬂuids Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed.

(gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed. The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes. Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehab center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your provider after you go home. Support Groups More information and support for people with stroke and their families can be found on the American Stroke Association website -- www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support [ support] . Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person does after a stroke depends on: The type of stroke How much brain tissue is damaged What body functions have been affected How quickly treatment is given Problems moving, thinking, and talking often start to improve in the days to weeks after a stroke. Many people develop depression after a stroke. This can slow down recovery but is also a very treatable complication of a stroke. Many people who have had a stroke will keep improving in the months or years after their stroke. Over half of people who have a stroke are able to function and live at home. Others are not able to care for themselves. If treatment with clot-busting medicines is successful, the symptoms of a stroke may go away. However, people often do not get to the hospital soon enough to receive these medicines, or they cannot take these medicines because of a health condition. People who have a stroke from a blood clot (ischemic stroke) have a better chance of surviving than those who have a stroke from bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). The risk for a second stroke is highest during the weeks or months after the ﬁrst stroke. The risk begins to decrease after this period. When to Contact a Medical Professional Stroke is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away. The acronym F.A.S.T. is an easy way to remember signs of stroke and what to do if you think a stroke has occurred. The most important action to take is to call 911 or the local emergency number right away for emergency assistance. F.A.S.T. stands for: FACE. Ask the person to smile. Check if one side of the face droops. ARMS. Ask the person to raise both arms. See if one arm drifts downward. SPEECH. Ask
