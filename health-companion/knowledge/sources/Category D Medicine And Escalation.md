Home → Medical Encyclopedia → Using over-the-counter medicines safely URL of this page: //medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm Using over-the-counter medicines safely Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems. Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines. About OTC Medicines You can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in: Drug stores Grocery stores Discount and department stores Convenience stores Some gas stations When used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by: Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches Providing ﬁrst aid When Should you use OTC Medicines It is ﬁne to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you: An official website of the United States governmentHere’s how you know National Institutes of Health /National Library of Medicine Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take What side effects or problems to watch for Your pharmacist can answer questions such as: What the medicine will do How it should be stored Whether another medicine might work as well or better What the Label can Tell you You can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label. Most OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to ﬁnd information you need. Here is what the label will show you: Active Ingredient. This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. Uses. The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. Warnings. Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not

what the label will show you: Active Ingredient. This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. Uses. The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. Warnings. Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. Directions. The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. Other Information. This includes such things as how to store the medicine. Inactive Ingredients. Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking. The label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed. Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely You should: Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should. Also be sure to take steps to keep kids safe. You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.

We are told that they can cure an illness or improve our symptoms, but that they can be dangerous if taken incorrectly. The key to dealing with medicines effectively is to understand them. Checking medicines When you pick up prescribed medicines, the pharmacist should explain each one to you, what they are for and how they should be taken. Always check the strength of the medicine - some formulations, especially liquid medicines, come in different strengths. Remember, if you have any questions, talk to your pharmacist. Taking medicines safely Use the medicines as directed on the label. Your medicine should have instructions for taking it either on a label or on the box or bottle.

pharmacist should explain each one to you, what they are for and how they should be taken. Always check the strength of the medicine - some formulations, especially liquid medicines, come in different strengths. Remember, if you have any questions, talk to your pharmacist. Taking medicines safely Use the medicines as directed on the label. Your medicine should have instructions for taking it either on a label or on the box or bottle. Always follow these instructions and never give more than the recommended dose. Sharing medicines can be dangerous. When they are prescribed, the doctor takes into account the patient’s symptoms and general health. Even though a friend or relative may have the same symptoms, they may have other factors that make the medicine unsuitable or even dangerous. Medicines should only be taken by the person for whom they were prescribed. You should have been told whether to give the medicine with or after food or on an empty stomach. This is important because the amount of food in the stomach affects how well the medicine is absorbed. Some medicines can irritate the stomach lining so it is best to take them with or after food to reduce the risk of irritation. Most tablets ( directory/how-give-your-child-tablets-or-capsules/) or capsules are best taken with a glass of water, preferably while sitting or standing. Some medicines interact with certain foods or drinks. For instance, some medicines should not be taken with milk as this can reduce how well they are absorbed. Other medicines, for instance, should not be taken with grapefruit juice. If you are unsure, please ask the pharmacist. If you are taking several doses each day, it can be difﬁcult to work out when to take them. With most medicines, you do not have to wake up during the night to take a dose, so you can spread out the doses throughout the day. If you are not sure of the times to give medicine, talk it over with the pharmacist. Taking more than one medicine Some medicines interact with other medicines. This can happen in various ways: one medicine might stop another from working so well, whereas others can increase the effect of another medicine. You should always tell the pharmacist about all your child’s medicines, including those bought over the counter, herbal and complementary medicines and other prescribed medicines. When your pharmacist knows about all of your child’s

the times to give medicine, talk it over with the pharmacist. Taking more than one medicine Some medicines interact with other medicines. This can happen in various ways: one medicine might stop another from working so well, whereas others can increase the effect of another medicine. You should always tell the pharmacist about all your child’s medicines, including those bought over the counter, herbal and complementary medicines and other prescribed medicines. When your pharmacist knows about all of your child’s medicines, he or she can work out if they are likely to interact. If there is a chance of an interaction, you might need to alter the schedule of doses so that the two medicines are not taken at the same time. Alternatively, your child might need to be prescribed another medicine altogether. If you are concerned about medicines interacting, please discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist. Changes in dose Medicine doses are worked out by age, that is, whether a child or an adult will take it. When prescribing medicines for children, their height and weight is taken into consideration as well. You may see a medicine dose described as mg/m², which is referring to a child’s ‘surface area’. This is calculated from a child’s height and weight, so the dose might be increased as a child grows. This is particularly true of medicines that are taken on a long-term basis as their effectiveness might reduce over time if the dose remains the same. If your child is prescribed a long-term medicine, your doctor may ask you to weigh and measure your child regularly and may change the dose accordingly. Alternative and complementary medicines This is the name often given to herbal or homeopathic medicines. These are different to mainstream medicines in that they are not subject to the same rigorous testing and there is some debate about whether they are effective and if so, how they work. One important point to remember is that although you can buy a vast range of alternative and complementary medicines over the counter, they can still have as harmful an effect if taken improperly as mainstream medicines can. For instance, certain vitamins can be harmful if taken at too high a dose and others are not recommended for children at all. Some alternative and complementary medicines, such as St John's Wort, can interact with prescribed medicines. Whether you decide to take

One important point to remember is that although you can buy a vast range of alternative and complementary medicines over the counter, they can still have as harmful an effect if taken improperly as mainstream medicines can. For instance, certain vitamins can be harmful if taken at too high a dose and others are not recommended for children at all. Some alternative and complementary medicines, such as St John's Wort, can interact with prescribed medicines. Whether you decide to take alternative and complementary medicines or not, it is important that you tell your doctor and pharmacist about all medicines you are taking. They will be able to advise about possible interactions. Storing medicines Always keep medicines out of sight and reach of children. Some medicines need to be kept in the fridge, but most at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and heat sources, such as radiators or ﬁres. The label should give storage instructions but check with your pharmacist if you are unsure. A locked medicine cabinet ( information/medicines-directory/how-safe-your-medicine-cabinet/) on the wall is often the safest place to store medicines. Most people keep their medicine cabinet in the bathroom, where it can be hot and steamy, and it could be better placed elsewhere in the home. Always keep medicines in their original packaging. It can be dangerous to ‘decant’ medicines into another container as it will be unlabelled, which could be dangerous if different medicines get mixed up and taken at the wrong time. Some medicines do not work as well once they have be removed from the packaging, such as tablets or capsules that come in blister packs. As well as showing the name of the medicine, the packaging usually protects it as well. Keep the patient information leaﬂet that comes in the package as well - this tells you important information about the medicine such as side effects and storage instructions. If you have trouble opening childproof containers, ask your pharmacist about optional devices for opening them. If you store medicines out of sight and reach of children, you might not need a childproof container. Disposing of unwanted medicines Medicines are expensive so do not ask for more than you need. It can also be risky to keep too many medicines at home. It is not advisable to ask for a bigger supply to save for another occasion as some medicines have a short expiry date. If

Disposing of unwanted medicines Medicines are expensive so do not ask for more than you need. It can also be risky to keep too many medicines at home. It is not advisable to ask for a bigger supply to save for another occasion as some medicines have a short expiry date. If your doctor decides to stop treatment with a medicine or change to a different one, return any unused liquids, tablets or capsules to the pharmacist. Do not ﬂush them down the toilet or throw them away. Do not hoard medicines if they are no longer required. It is a good idea to check your medicine cabinet on a regular basis, returning any unused or unwanted medicines to the pharmacist for disposal. Asking questions Your pharmacist should always be your ﬁrst port of call if you have any questions about medicines. Most community pharmacies have a quiet room where you can talk to a pharmacist in private and many keep a selection of health information leaﬂets as well. If your child is a patient at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and you would like to know more about his or her medicines, please call Pharmacy Medicines Informationon 020 7829 8608 (Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm). Please note that we might not be able to give advice to parents of children not currently being treated at GOSH. If your child is not a patient at GOSH, please contact the hospital looking after your child or your family doctor (GP).

If you do not have a copy of the manufacturer’s patient information leaﬂet please talk to your pharmacist. A few products do not have a marketing authorisation (licence) as a medicine and therefore there is no PIL. For children in particular, there may be conﬂicts of information between the manufacturer’s patient information leaﬂet (PIL) and guidance provided by GOSH and other healthcare providers. For example, some manufacturers may recommend, in the patient information leaﬂet, that a medicine is not given to children

do not have a copy of the manufacturer’s patient information leaﬂet please talk to your pharmacist. A few products do not have a marketing authorisation (licence) as a medicine and therefore there is no PIL. For children in particular, there may be conﬂicts of information between the manufacturer’s patient information leaﬂet (PIL) and guidance provided by GOSH and other healthcare providers. For example, some manufacturers may recommend, in the patient information leaﬂet, that a medicine is not given to children aged under 12 years. In most cases, this is because the manufacturer will recruit adults to clinical trials in the ﬁrst instance and therefore the initial marketing authorisation (licence) only covers adults and older children. For new medicines, the manufacturer then has to recruit children and newborns into trials (unless the medicine is not going to be used in children and newborns) and subsequently amend the PIL with the approved information. Older medicines may have been used effectively for many years in children without problems but the manufacturer has not been required to collect data and amend the licence. This does not mean that it is unsafe for children and young people to be prescribed such a medicine ‘off-licence/off- label’. However, if you are concerned about any conﬂicts of information, please discuss with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Healthy Habits: Antibiotic Do's and Don'ts KEY POINTS Antibiotics can save lives, but they aren't always the answer. Take these steps to use antibiotics appropriately so you can get the best treatment when you're sick, protect yourself from side effects caused by unnecessary antibiotic use and combat antimicrobial resistance. MORE INFORMATION For Everyone Health Care Providers Public Health Take antibiotics ONLY when you need them Antibiotics ONLY treat certain infections caused by bacteria, such as: Strep throat Whooping cough Urinary tract infection (UTI) Some infections caused by bacteria can still get better without antibiotics. You DO NOT need antibiotics for some common bacterial infections, including many sinus infections and some ear infections. Antibiotics DO NOT work on viruses. Viruses are germs different from bacteria. Antibiotics do not treat infections caused by viruses such as those that cause: Colds and runny noses, even if the mucus is thick, yellow or green Most sore throats (except strep throat) Flu Most cases of chest colds (bronchitis) Antibiotics will NOT make you feel better if you have a virus.

Antibiotics do not treat infections caused by viruses such as those that cause: Colds and runny noses, even if the mucus is thick, yellow or green Most sore throats (except strep throat) Flu Most cases of chest colds (bronchitis) Antibiotics will NOT make you feel better if you have a virus. Taking antibiotics when you do not need them will not help you, and their side effects can still cause harm. Talk to a healthcare professional about the best treatment for you when you are sick. Never pressure a healthcare professional to prescribe an antibiotic. Take antibiotics exactly as prescribed Reminder Antibiotics aren't always the answer when you're sick. Ask a healthcare professional for tips on how to feel better while your body fights off an infection.For Everyone SEPT. 23, 2025• Antibiotic Prescribing and Use If antibiotics are the best treatment when you're sick: Take them exactly as prescribed. Do not share your antibiotics with others. Do not save them for later. Taking the wrong medicine for a future illness may delay correct treatment and can cause severe side effects. Do not take antibiotics prescribed for someone else. This may delay the best treatment for you, make you even sicker or cause side effects. Disposal of medicines For any expired or unused medications: Dispose through drug take-back programs, often located within community pharmacies. Place in a plastic bag with dirt, kitty litter or used coffee grounds and throw away in the household trash. Talk to a pharmacist about safely discarding leftover medicines. See helpful tips on how to safely throw away unused medications . Talk to a healthcare provider about side effects of antibiotics If a healthcare professional determines that you need antibiotics, the benefits usually outweigh the risks of side effects and antimicrobial resistance. Common side effects of antibiotics range from minor to very severe health problems and can include: Rash Dizziness Nausea Diarrhea Yeast infections More serious side effects can include: C. diff infection, which causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and deaths.

It is estimated that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths (1). The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals and plants are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. AMR affects countries in all regions and at all income levels. Its drivers and consequences are exacerbated by poverty and inequality, and low- and middle-income countries are most affected. AMR puts many of the gains of modern medicine at risk. It makes infections harder to treat and makes other medical procedures and treatments – such as surgery, caesarean sections and cancer chemotherapy – much riskier. The world faces an antibiotics pipeline and access crisis. There is an inadequate research and development pipeline in the face of rising levels of resistance, and urgent need for additional measures to ensure equitable access to new and existing vaccines, diagnostics and medicines. In addition to death and disability, AMR has signiﬁcant economic costs. The World Bank estimates that AMR could result in US$ 1 trillion additional healthcare costs by 2050, and US$ 1 trillion to US$

– much riskier. The world faces an antibiotics pipeline and access crisis. There is an inadequate research and development pipeline in the face of rising levels of resistance, and urgent need for additional measures to ensure equitable access to new and existing vaccines, diagnostics and medicines. In addition to death and disability, AMR has signiﬁcant economic costs. The World Bank estimates that AMR could result in US$ 1 trillion additional healthcare costs by 2050, and US$ 1 trillion to US$ 3.4 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) losses per year by 2030 (2). Priorities to address AMR in human health include preventing all infections, which may result in inappropriate use of antimicrobials; ensuring universal access to quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections; and strategic information and innovation, for example surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial consumption/use, and research and development for novel vaccines, diagnostics and medicines. Overview Antimicrobials – including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitics – are medicines used to prevent and treat infectious diseases in hum ans, animals and plants. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become ineffective and infections become difficult or impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, disability and death. AMR is a natural process that happens over time through genetic changes in pathogens. Its emergence and spread is accelerated by human activity, mainly the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials to treat, prevent or control infections in humans, animals and plants. A global concern Antimicrobial medicines are the cornerstone of modern medicine.The emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens threatens our ability to treat common infections and to perform life-saving procedures including cancer chemotherapy and caesarean section, hip replacements, organ transplantation and other surgeries. In addition, drug-resistant infections impact the health of animals and plants, reduce productivity in farms, and threaten food security. AMR has significant costs for both health systems and national economies overall. For example, it creates need for more expensive and intensive care, affects productivity of patients or their caregivers through prolonged hospital stays, and harms agricultural productivity. AMR is a problem for all countries at all income levels. Its spread does not recognize country borders. Contributing factors include lack of access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for both humans and animals; poor infection and disease prevention and

AMR has significant costs for both health systems and national economies overall. For example, it creates need for more expensive and intensive care, affects productivity of patients or their caregivers through prolonged hospital stays, and harms agricultural productivity. AMR is a problem for all countries at all income levels. Its spread does not recognize country borders. Contributing factors include lack of access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for both humans and animals; poor infection and disease prevention and control in homes, healthcare facilities and farms; poor access to quality and affordable vaccines, diagnostics and medicines; lack of awareness and knowledge; and lack of enforcement of relevant legislation. People living in low-resource settings and vulnerable populations are especially impacted by both the drivers and consequences of AMR. What is the present situation? Drug-resistance in bacteria The global rise in antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat, diminishing the efficacy of common antibiotics against widespread bacterial infections. The 2022 Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) report highlights alarming resistance rates among prevalent bacterial pathogens. Median reported rates in 76 countries of 42% for third- generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and 35% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are a major concern. For urinary tract infections caused by E. coli, 1 in 5 cases exhibited reduced susceptibility to standard antibiotics like ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and fluoroquinolones in 2020. This is making it harder to effectively treat common infections. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common intestinal bacterium, also showed elevated resistance levels against critical antibiotics. Increased levels of resistance potentially lead to heightened utilization of last-resort drugs like carbapenems, for which resistance is in turn being observed across multiple regions. As the effectiveness of these last-resort drugs is compromised, the risks increase of infections that cannot be treated. Projections by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicate an anticipated twofold surge in resistance to last-resort antibiotics by 2035, compared to 2005 levels, underscoring the urgent need for robust antimicrobial stewardship practices and enhanced surveillance coverage worldwide. Drug resistance in fungi As drug-resistant fungal infections increase, WHO is monitoring their magnitude and public health impact. Fungal infections can be difficult to treat, including due to drug-drug interactions for patients with other infections (e.g. HIV). The emergence and spread of multi- drug resistant Candida auris, an invasive fungal infection, is of particular concern. Development of WHO’s Fungal Priority Pathogens List (see below) included a comprehensive review of

need for robust antimicrobial stewardship practices and enhanced surveillance coverage worldwide. Drug resistance in fungi As drug-resistant fungal infections increase, WHO is monitoring their magnitude and public health impact. Fungal infections can be difficult to treat, including due to drug-drug interactions for patients with other infections (e.g. HIV). The emergence and spread of multi- drug resistant Candida auris, an invasive fungal infection, is of particular concern. Development of WHO’s Fungal Priority Pathogens List (see below) included a comprehensive review of fungal infections and drug-resistant fungi globally. Drug resistance in HIV, tuberculosis and malaria HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) is caused by changes in the HIV genome that affect the ability of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to block the replication of the virus. HIVDR can either be transm itted at the time of infection or acquired because of inadequate adherence to treatment or drug- drug interactions. HIVDR can lead to increased HIV infections and HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. WHO recommends that countries routinely implement HIVDR surveys to inform the selection of optimal ARV drug regimens for HIV prevention and treatment. Tuberculosis (TB) is a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using second-line drugs, but these medicines are expensive and toxic, and in some cases more extensive drug resistance can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective second-line TB drugs can leave patients with very limited treatment options. MDR-TB is therefore a public health crisis and threat to health security. Only about 2 in 5 people with drug resistant TB accessed treatment in 2022. The emergence of drug-resistant parasites is a major threat to malaria control. Artemisinin- based combination therapies (ACTs) are the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and are used by most malaria endemic countries. Emergence of partial resistance to artemisinin and/or partner drugs in ACTs makes selecting the right treatment more challenging and requires close monitoring. In the Greater Mekong Subregion, partial resistance to artemisinin or a partner drug has been confirmed in several countries since 2001. In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, resistance to a partner drug, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, led in some countries to treatment failure requiring a change to another ACT. In Africa, mutations linked to artemisinin partial resistance have been

endemic countries. Emergence of partial resistance to artemisinin and/or partner drugs in ACTs makes selecting the right treatment more challenging and requires close monitoring. In the Greater Mekong Subregion, partial resistance to artemisinin or a partner drug has been confirmed in several countries since 2001. In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, resistance to a partner drug, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, led in some countries to treatment failure requiring a change to another ACT. In Africa, mutations linked to artemisinin partial resistance have been observed in several countries. ACTs that have been tested remain efficacious, but further spread of resistance could be a major public health challenge and improved surveillance is vital. Drug resistance in neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) The emergence of drug resistance against medicines for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is a significant threat to programmes to control, eliminate and eradicate NTDs, which especially affect vulnerable and marginalized populations. Resistance has been reported in leprosy medicines (dapsone, rifampicine and clofazimine) in several countries, in several anti- helminthics (while resistance has so far only been observed in use in animals, which is a serious concern for the veterinary sector, some of these medicines are also used in hum ans), in medicines used to treat human African trypanosomiasis (melarsoprol) and leishmaniasis (pentavalent antimonials, miltefosine), and others. It is important to monitor resistance and drug efficacy, put in place strategies to delay or curb resistance, and strengthen the pipeline of second-line medicines for NTDs. For example, WHO provides guidance for surveillance of resistance for the global leprosy elimination programme, and support to control distribution and monitor the standardized use, safety and efficacy of medicines, including donated medicines, in NTD programmes. Coordinated global action to address AMR One Health approach AMR is a complex problem that requires both sector-specific actions in the human health, food production, animal and environmental sectors, and a coordinated approach across these sectors. One Health refers to an integrated, unifying approach that aims to achieve optimal and sustainable health outcomes for people, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes that the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants and the wider environment are closely linked and inter-dependent. The One Health approach to preventing and controlling AMR brings together stakeholders from relevant sectors to communicate and work together in the design, implementation and monitoring of programmes, policies, legislation and research to mitigate AMR and attain better health and economic outcomes.

to achieve optimal and sustainable health outcomes for people, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes that the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants and the wider environment are closely linked and inter-dependent. The One Health approach to preventing and controlling AMR brings together stakeholders from relevant sectors to communicate and work together in the design, implementation and monitoring of programmes, policies, legislation and research to mitigate AMR and attain better health and economic outcomes. Global Action Plan (GAP) on Antimicrobial Resistance To address AMR globally, countries adopted the Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR during the 2015 World Health Assembly and committed to the development and implementation of multisectoral national action plans with a One Health approach to tackle AMR. The GAP was subsequently endorsed by the Governing Bodies of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly known as OIE) and the United Nations Environment Program. Quadripartite Joint Secretariat on Antimicrobial Resistance To coordinate the One Health global response to AMR, WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). The 4 organizations (FAO, UNEP, WHO and WOAH) are known as the Quadripartite. A quadripartite joint secretariat is hosted by WHO to drive multi-stakeholder engagement in AMR. This has supported establishment of the Global Leaders Group on AMR, which began its work in November 2020, and the Multi- Stakeholder Partnership Platform, which was launched in November 2022, and several technical working groups. High-level meetings on AMR In March 2022, United Nations General Assembly resolution A/RES/76/257 established a second High-level Meeting on AMR to be held in 2024, in collaboration with the Quadripartite Organizations and with the support of the Global Leaders Group. In October 2023, The President of the General Assembly appointed the Permanent Representatives of Barbados and Malta to co-facilitate the high-level meeting. The high-level meeting is an important opportunity for countries to make ambitious commitments and agree targets, and the Quadripartite Joint Secretariat is working closely with the co-facilitators and Global Leaders Group to ensure optimal participation and inputs from the human, animal, agri-food and the environment sectors. In addition, three Global High-level Ministerial Conferences on AMR, in the Netherlands in 2014 and 2019, and in Oman in 2022, led to the Global Action Plan, the AMR

The high-level meeting is an important opportunity for countries to make ambitious commitments and agree targets, and the Quadripartite Joint Secretariat is working closely with the co-facilitators and Global Leaders Group to ensure optimal participation and inputs from the human, animal, agri-food and the environment sectors. In addition, three Global High-level Ministerial Conferences on AMR, in the Netherlands in 2014 and 2019, and in Oman in 2022, led to the Global Action Plan, the AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund, and groundbreaking multisectoral AMR targets. A fourth high-level ministerial conference will be hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2024. World AMR Awareness Week (WAAW) World AMR Awareness Week (WAAW) is a global campaign to raise awareness, understanding and best practices with the public, One Health stakeholders, and other policymakers. One of WHO’s official health campaigns since 2015, WAAW is celebrated from 18 to 24 November every year. A programmatic response to AMR in countries AMR national action plans As of November 2023, 178 countries had developed AMR national action plans aligned with the GAP. To ensure sustained progress, countries need to establish a functioning multisectoral AMR governance mechanism, prioritize activities, develop a costed operational plan, mobilize resources (both domestic and external), and effectively implement their plan. Monitoring mechanisms are needed to track progress, identify challenges and report periodically. To globally track the progress in AMR national action plan implementation, countries have committed to completing the multisectoral annual Tracking AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey (TrACSS) that was launched in 2016 with results published at The people-centred approach and WHO core package of interventions To address AMR in a programmatic manner that puts people, their needs and equitable access to health services at the centre of the AMR response in the community, in primary care, secondary and tertiary care, and at national and/or subnational level, WHO has developed the People-centred approach to addressing antimicrobial resistance in human health and WHO core package of interventions to support national action plans. This focuses on preventing infections and ensuring universal access to health services for quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment. As a crucial part of their AMR response, countries can integrate the core package of AMR interventions in national plans and strategies for universal health coverage and health emergency preparedness and response.

and WHO core package of interventions to support national action plans. This focuses on preventing infections and ensuring universal access to health services for quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment. As a crucial part of their AMR response, countries can integrate the core package of AMR interventions in national plans and strategies for universal health coverage and health emergency preparedness and response. Antimicrobial stewardship and AWaRe Antimicrobial stewardship is a systematic approach to educate and support health care professionals to follow evidence-based guidelines for prescribing and administering antimicrobials. The education of the health workforce is of crucial importance, as they form the front line in safeguarding the effectiveness of antimicrobial medicines. WHO guides countries to develop and implement Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes as one of the most cost-effective interventions to optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines, improve patient outcomes and reduce AMR and health care-associated infections. To improve access to appropriate treatment and reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics, WHO developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics. The WHO AWaRe antibiotic book provides concise, evidence-based guidance on the choice of antibiotic, dose, route of administration, and duration of treatment for more than 30 of the most common clinical infections in children and adults in both primary health care and hospital settings. Strategic information to inform the AMR response WHO launched the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) in 2015 to fill knowledge gaps and inform strategies at all levels. GLASS progressively incorporates data from surveillance of AMR in hum ans, surveillance of the use and consumption of antimicrobials, and integrated AMR data in the One Health sectors including the food chain and in the environment. GLASS provides a standardized approach to the collection, analysis, interpretation and sharing of data by countries, territories and areas. It also monitors the status of existing and new national surveillance systems, with emphasis on representativeness and quality of data collection. Some WHO regions have established surveillance networks that provide technical support to countries and facilitate enrollment into GLASS. WHO is committed especially to supporting low- and middle-income countries to improve data collection and usage for policymaking, both through GLASS and by supporting nationally representative AMR prevalence surveys.

established surveillance networks that provide technical support to countries and facilitate enrollment into GLASS. WHO is committed especially to supporting low- and middle-income countries to improve data collection and usage for policymaking, both through GLASS and by supporting nationally representative AMR prevalence surveys. Priority-setting for AMR research and product development The clinical pipeline of new antimicrobials is almost dry and there is a pipeline and access crisis for antibiotics. WHO’s latest annual review of the pre-clinical and clinical antibacterial pipelines identified 27 antibiotics in clinical development that address WHO bacterial priority pathogens, of which only 6 were classified as innovative. In addition, a lack of access to quality antimicrobials and shortages of generic off-patent antibiotics affect countries across all levels of income and development. To guide research and development into new antimicrobials, diagnostics and vaccines, and inform public health action, WHO developed the first WHO bacterial priority pathogens list in 2017 and updated this in 2023 (publication forthcoming), and published the WHO fungal priority pathogen list in 2022. To help fill the major gaps in R&D for antimicrobials, vaccines and diagnostic tools, WHO works closely with organizations such as the Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership (GARDP), the AMR Action Fund, and the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X). Various governments are also piloting different models to incentivize research and development of newer antimicrobials to ultimately ensur e access to treatment. Greater innovation and investment are also required in epidemiological and operational research. WHO has outlined 40 priority research topics for AMR in human health and, with the Quadripartite organizations, a One Health priority research agenda for AMR. References 1.

vs. Urgent Care: What's the difference? It's Saturday morning and your child fell while playing in the backyard. He can't put any weight on his rapidly swelling ankle, and he is sweating and crying in pain. Should you head to the Emergency Department or Urgent Care? If you have been in a similar situation and wondered which option is better, you are not alone. Although Mayo Clinic Health System has offered Urgent Care for more than 20 years, many people are confused about when to use it. Here are a few differences between Emergency Departments and Urgent Care clinics: Severity of health problemsSkip to m ain content An Emergency Department treats life- or limb-threatening health conditions in people of all ages. It is the best option when you require immediate medical attention. Urgent Care is the middle ground between your primary care provider and the Emergency Department. If you have a minor illness or injury that can't wait until tomorrow, Urgent Care is the way to go. Also, it is a good option if you have illnesses or injuries without other symptoms, or if you do not have other underlying health conditions. For example, an earache can easily be treated in Urgent Care. However, if it is accompanied by a high fever (104 F or higher), or you have a history of cancer or are on immune-suppressing medication, it is important to have it checked out in the Emergency Department. Hours and staff Emergency Departments are staffed 24/7 with physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and nurses trained in delivering emergency care. The team has quick access to expert providers in advanced specialties such as Cardiology, Neurology and Orthopedics. Emergency Departments also have the imaging and laboratory resources needed to diagnose and deliver care for severe and life- threatening situations. Typically, Urgent Care clinics are staffed with physician assistants, nurse practitioners and nurses. Although, some Urgent Care clinics have physicians on staff as well. Urgent Care providers can order basic labs and imaging tests, such as X-rays, to help them provide diagnoses and develop treatment plans. Urgent Care clinics have set hours and an established list of conditions treated. As a result, Urgent Care clinics often are less expensive and have shorter wait times than Emergency Departments. Here are examples of types of conditions treated in Urgent Care clinics and Emergency Departments: Urgent Care clinic: Back or muscle pain Bronchitis Cuts

Causes Anaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that has become an allergen. An allergen is a substance that, for most people, is harmless, but in some people, it can cause an allergic reaction. After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. When the person is exposed to that allergen again, an allergic reaction may occur. Anaphylaxis usually happens quickly after the exposure. The condition is severe and involves the whole body. Tissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms. Some medicines (morphine, x-ray dye, aspirin, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (often called an anaphylactoid reaction) when people are ﬁrst exposed to them. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with true anaphylaxis. But, the symptoms, risk of complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions. Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include: Medicine allergies Food allergies Insect bites/stings Pollen and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some people have an anaphylactic reaction with no known cause. An official website of the United States governmentHere’s how you know National Institutes of Health /National Library of Medicine Anaphylaxis is life threatening and can occur at any time. Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction. Symptoms Symptoms develop quickly, often within seconds or minutes.

Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction. Symptoms Symptoms develop quickly, often within seconds or minutes. They may include any of the following: Abdominal pain Feeling anxious Chest discomfort or tightness Diarrhea Diﬃculty breathing, coughing, wheezing, or high-pitched breathing sounds Diﬃculty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Hives, itchiness, redness of the skin Nasal congestion Nausea or vomiting Palpitations Slurred speech Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine the person and ask about what might have caused the condition. Tests for the allergen that caused anaphylaxis (if the cause is not obvious) may be done after treatment. Treatment Anaphylaxis is an emergency condition that needs medical attention right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number immediately. Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation, which are known as the ABC's of Basic Life Support. A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR. 1. Call 911 or the local emergency number. 2. Calm and reassure the person. 3. If the allergic reaction is from a bee sting, scrape the stinger off the skin with something ﬁrm (such as a ﬁngernail or plastic credit card). Do not use tweezers. Squeezing the stinger will release more venom. 4. If the person has emergency allergy medicine on hand, help them take or inject it. Do not give medicine by the mouth if the person is having diﬃculty breathing. An epinephrine injector should be used immediately if it is available. 5. Take steps to prevent shock. Have the person lie ﬂat, raise the person's feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters), and cover the person with a coat or blanket. Do not place the person in this position if a head, neck, back, or leg injury is suspected, or if it causes discomfort. DO NOT: Do not assume that any allergy shots the person has already received will provide complete protection. Do not place a pillow under the person's head if they are having trouble breathing. This can block the airways. Do not give the person anything by mouth if they are having trouble breathing. Paramedics or

coat or blanket. Do not place the person in this position if a head, neck, back, or leg injury is suspected, or if it causes discomfort. DO NOT: Do not assume that any allergy shots the person has already received will provide complete protection. Do not place a pillow under the person's head if they are having trouble breathing. This can block the airways. Do not give the person anything by mouth if they are having trouble breathing. Paramedics or other providers may place a tube through the nose or mouth into the airways. Or emergency surgery will be done to place a tube directly into the trachea. The person may receive medicines to further reduce symptoms. Outlook (Prognosis) Anaphylaxis can be life threatening without prompt treatment. Symptoms usually do get better with the right therapy, so it is important to act right away. Possible Complications Without prompt treatment, anaphylaxis may result in: Blocked airway Cardiac arrest (no effective heartbeat) Respiratory arrest (no breathing) Shock Death When to Contact a Medical Professional Call 911 or the local emergency number if you or someone you know develops severe symptoms of anaphylaxis. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. Prevention To prevent allergic reactions and anaphylaxis: Avoid triggers such as foods and medicines that have caused an allergic reaction in the past. Ask detailed questions about ingredients when you are eating away from home. Also carefully examine ingredient labels. If you have a child who is allergic to certain foods, introduce one new food at a time in small amounts so you can recognize an allergic reaction. People who know that they have had serious allergic reactions should wear a medical ID tag or bracelet. If you have a history of serious allergic reactions, carry injectable epinephrine according to your provider's instructions. There is no contraindication to using epinephrine in a severe allergic reaction.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main cause of heart attack. What it is A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart muscle. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main cause of heart attack. A less common cause is a severe spasm, or sudden contraction, of a coronary artery that can stop blood flow to the heart muscle. Symptoms Know the heart attack signs for men and women.For Everyone OCTOBER 24, 2024 Heart Disease The major symptoms of a heart attack are: Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back.

of a coronary artery that can stop blood flow to the heart muscle. Symptoms Know the heart attack signs for men and women.For Everyone OCTOBER 24, 2024 Heart Disease The major symptoms of a heart attack are: Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. Feeling weak, light-headed, or faint. You may also break into a cold sweat. Pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back. Pain or discomfort in one or both arms or shoulders. Shortness of breath. This often comes along with chest discomfort, but shortness of breath also can happen before chest discomfort. Other symptoms of a heart attack could include unusual or unexplained tiredness and nausea or vomiting. Women are more likely to have these other symptoms. Learn more about women and heart disease. Call 9-1-1 if you notice symptoms of a heart attack If you notice the symptoms of a heart attack in yourself or someone else, call 9-1-1 immediately. The sooner you get to an emergency room, the sooner you can get treatment to reduce the amount of damage to the heart muscle. At the hospital, health care professionals can run tests to find out if a heart attack is happening and can decide the best treatment. In some cases, a heart attack requires cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or an electrical shock (defibrillation) to the heart to get the heart pumping again. Bystanders trained to use CPR or a defibrillator may be able to help until emergency medical personnel arrive. Remember, the chances of surviving a heart attack are better the sooner emergency treatment begins. Risk factors Several health conditions, your lifestyle, and your age and family history can increase your risk for heart disease and heart attack. These are called risk factors. In addition, about half of all Americans have at least one of these three key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking. Some risk factors cannot be controlled, such as your age or family history. But you can take steps to lower your risk by changing the factors you can control.

Some risk factors cannot be controlled, such as your age or family history. But you can take steps to lower your risk by changing the factors you can control. Learn more about risk factors for heart disease and heart attack. What to do to recover after a heart attack If you've had a heart attack, your heart may be damaged. This could affect your heart's rhythm and its ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. You may also be at risk for another heart attack or conditions such as stroke, kidney disorders, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). You can lower your chances of having future health problems following a heart attack with these steps: Physical activity: Talk with your health care team about the things you do each day in your life and work. Your doctor may want you to limit work, travel, or sexual activity for some time after a heart attack. Lifestyle changes: Eating a healthier diet, increasing physical activity, quitting smoking, and managing stress—in addition to taking prescribed medicines—can help improve your heart health and quality of life. Ask your health care team about attending a program called cardiac rehabilitation to help you make these lifestyle changes. Cardiac rehabilitation: Cardiac rehabilitation is an important program for anyone recovering from a heart attack, heart failure, or other heart problem that required surgery or medical care. Cardiac rehab is a supervised program that includes: Physical activity. Education about healthy living, including healthy eating, taking medicine as prescribed, and ways to help you quit smoking. Counseling to find ways to relieve stress and improve mental health.

The faster you act, the better their chances. Symptoms of a heart attack Symptoms of a heart attack can include: chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy feeling lightheaded or dizzy sweating shortness of breath feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack) coughing or wheezing The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion. While the most common symptom is chest pain, symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain without any chest pain. Waiting for an ambulance If you have had a heart attack, it's important that you rest while you wait for an ambulance, to avoid unnecessary strain on your heart. If aspirin is available and you are not allergic to it, slowly chew and then swallow an adult-size tablet (300mg) while you wait for the ambulance. Aspirin helps to thin your blood and improve blood flow to your heart.Health A to Z (Link: www.nhs.uk/health-a-to-z/) NHS services (Link: www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/) Overview (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/) Symptoms Causes (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/causes/) Diagnosis (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/diagnosis/) Treatment (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/treatment/) Recovery (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/recovery/) Complications (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/complications/) Prevention (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/prevention/)More Cardiac arrest In some cases, a complication called ventricular arrhythmia can cause the heart to stop beating.

This is known as sudden cardiac arrest. Signs and symptoms that suggest a person has gone into cardiac arrest include: they appear not to be breathing they're not moving they don't respond to any stimulation, such as being touched or spoken to If you think somebody has gone into cardiac arrest, call 999 immediately and start doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (Link: www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/first-aid/cpr/). If there is someone with you, ask them to find an automated external defibrillator (AED) and use it as soon as you can. Hands-only CPR (chest compressions) To do chest compressions on an adult: 1. Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person's chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and interlock your fingers. 2. Using your body weight (not just your arms), press straight down by 5 to 6cm on their chest. 3. Repeat this until an ambulance arrives. Aim to do 100 to 120 compressions a minute. Find out about how to resuscitate a child (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/resuscitating-a- baby/). Automated external defibrillator (AED) If you have access to an AED, you should use it. An AED is a safe, portable electrical device that most large organisations keep as part of first aid equipment. It helps to establish a regular heartbeat during a cardiac arrest by monitoring the person's heartbeat and giving them an electric shock if necessary.

(Link: defibrillators) Angina and heart attacks Angina (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/) is chest pain caused by the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart becoming restricted. People with angina can experience similar symptoms to a heart attack, but they usually happen during exercise and pass within a few minutes. However, occasionally, people with angina can have a heart attack. It's important to recognise the difference between the symptoms of angina and those of a heart attack. Symptoms of angina can be controlled with a medicine called glyceryl trinitrate that's prescribed for people who have angina. The medicine should improve the symptoms within 5 minutes. If you're having a heart attack, the medicine will not work. If the first dose of glyceryl trinitrate you take does not work after 5 minutes, take a second dose. If the second dose does not work after 5 minutes, call 999. Call 999 sooner if the pain gets worse or you also feel unwell, sick, dizzy or short of breath.

They may include: face weakness – one side of your face may droop (fall) and it might be hard to smile arm weakness – you may not be able to fully lift both arms and keep them there because of weakness or numbness in 1 arm speech problems – you may slur your words or sound confused The easiest way to remember these symptoms is the word FAST. This stands for: face, arms, speech and time to call 999. Other symptoms of a stroke There are other signs that you or someone else is having a stroke. These include: weakness or numbness down 1 side of your body blurred vision or loss of sight in 1 or both eyes finding it difficult to speak or think of words confusion and memory loss feeling dizzy or falling over a severe headache feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting) Symptoms of a stroke can sometimes stop after a short time, so you may think you're OK.

A stroke is sometimes called a "brain attack." If blood ﬂow is cut off for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get nutrients and oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing lasting damage. A stroke can also occur if a blood vessel inside the brain bursts, leading to bleeding inside the head. Causes There are two major types of stroke: Ischemic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways: A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke. A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke. Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries. Watch this video about: Stroke A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include: An

Watch this video about: Stroke A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include: An official website of the United States governmentHere’s how you know National Institutes of Health /National Library of Medicine Aneurysm (weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out) Arteriovenous malformation (AVM; abnormal connection between the arteries and veins) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; condition in which proteins called amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain) Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and warfarin or has a bleeding disorder. Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke. High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes. Other major risk factors are: Irregular heartbeat, called atrial ﬁbrillation Diabetes Smoking Family history of stroke Being male High cholesterol Increasing age, especially after age 55 Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke) Obesity History of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (occurs when blood ﬂow to a part of the brain stops for a brief time) Stroke risk is also higher in: People who have heart disease or poor blood ﬂow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as excessive use of alcohol, use of recreational drugs, a high-fat diet, or lack of exercise People who have a hereditary tendency to develop blood clots Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are older than 35) Women who are pregnant Women who take hormone replacement therapy Patent foramen ovale (PFO), a hole between the left and right atria (upper chambers) of the heart People who have sleep disorders (such as obstructive sleep apnea) Symptoms Symptoms of stroke depend on which part of the brain is damaged.

In some cases, a person may not know that a stroke has occurred. Most of the time, symptoms develop suddenly and without warning. But symptoms may occur on and off for the ﬁrst day or two. Symptoms are usually most severe when the stroke ﬁrst happens, but they may slowly get worse. A headache may occur if the stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. The headache: Starts suddenly and may be severe May be worse when you are lying ﬂat May wake you up from sleep May get worse when you change positions or when you bend, strain, or cough Other symptoms depend on how severe the stroke is, and what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms may include: Change in alertness (including sleepiness, unconsciousness, and coma) Changes in hearing or taste Changes that affect touch and the ability to feel pain, pressure, or different temperatures Confusion or loss of memory Problems swallowing Problems writing or reading Dizziness or abnormal feeling of movement (vertigo) Eyesight problems, such as decreased vision, double vision, or total loss of vision Lack of control over the bladder or bowels Loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking Muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg (usually just on one side) Numbness or tingling on one side of the body Personality, mood, or emotional changes Trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking Exams and Tests Your health care provider will do a physical exam to: Check for problems with vision, movement, feeling, reﬂexes, understanding, and speaking. Your provider and nurses will repeat this exam over time to see if your stroke is getting worse or improving. Listen to the carotid arteries in the neck with a stethoscope for an abnormal sound, called a bruit, which is caused by abnormal blood ﬂow. Check for high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. You may have the following tests to help ﬁnd the type, location, and cause of the stroke and check for other problems:

reﬂexes, understanding, and speaking. Your provider and nurses will repeat this exam over time to see if your stroke is getting worse or improving. Listen to the carotid arteries in the neck with a stethoscope for an abnormal sound, called a bruit, which is caused by abnormal blood ﬂow. Check for high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. You may have the following tests to help ﬁnd the type, location, and cause of the stroke and check for other problems: CT scan or MRI scan of the brain to determine the location of the stroke, and if there is a mass, or any bleeding Angiogram of the head to look for a blood vessel that is blocked or bleeding Carotid duplex (ultrasound) to see if the carotid arteries in your neck have narrowed Echocardiogram to see if the stroke could have been caused by a blood clot from the heart Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CT angiography to check for abnormal blood vessels in the brain Other tests include: Blood tests Electroencephalogram (EEG) to determine if there are seizures Electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rhythm monitoring Treatment A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 911 or the local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the ﬁrst signs of a stroke. People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible. If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting medicine may be given to dissolve the clot (also called thrombolytic therapy). To be effective, this treatment must be started within 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms ﬁrst started. However, the sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome. Endovascular thrombectomy may be needed. This is when a catheter is inserted into your arteries. Dye is injected while images of your brain's blood vessels are reviewed. A clot, if found, could be removed through the catheter. Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include: Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin, direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix) Medicine to control risk factors for stroke, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes Nutrients and ﬂuids Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in

could be removed through the catheter. Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include: Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin, direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix) Medicine to control risk factors for stroke, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes Nutrients and ﬂuids Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed. The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes. Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehab center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your provider after you go home. Support Groups More information and support for people with stroke and their families can be found on the American Stroke Association website -- www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support [ support] . Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person does after a stroke depends on: The type of stroke How much brain tissue is damaged What body functions have been affected How quickly treatment is given Problems moving, thinking, and talking often start to improve in the days to weeks after a stroke. Many people develop depression after a stroke. This can slow down recovery but is also a very treatable complication of a stroke. Many people who have had a stroke will keep improving in the months or years after their stroke. Over half of people who have a stroke are able to function and live at home. Others are not able to care for themselves. If treatment with clot-busting medicines is successful, the symptoms of a stroke may go away. However, people often do not get to the hospital soon enough to receive these medicines, or they cannot take these medicines because of a health condition. People who have a stroke from a blood clot (ischemic stroke) have a better chance of surviving than those who have a stroke from bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). The risk for a second stroke is highest during the weeks or months after the ﬁrst stroke. The risk begins to decrease after this

When to Contact a Medical Professional Stroke is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away. The acronym F.A.S.T. is an easy way to remember signs of stroke and what to do if you think a stroke has occurred. The most important action to take is to call 911 or the local emergency number right away for emergency assistance. F.A.S.T. stands for: FACE. Ask the person to smile. Check if one side of the face droops. ARMS. Ask the person to raise both arms. See if one arm drifts downward. SPEECH. Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Check if words are slurred and if the sentence is repeated correctly. TIME. If a person shows any of these symptoms, time is essential. It is important to get to the hospital as quickly as possible. Call 911 or the local emergency number. Act F.A.S.T. Prevention Reducing your stroke risk factors lessens your chance of having a stroke.
