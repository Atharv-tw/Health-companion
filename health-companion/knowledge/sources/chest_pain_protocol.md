**Source:** Derived from CDC & NHS Guidelines
**Type:** Emergency Red Flags

## Critical Warning Signs (Call Emergency Services Immediately)
If the patient experiences ANY of the following with chest pain, this is a medical emergency:

1.  **Pressure/Squeezing:** A feeling of fullness, squeezing, or heavy pressure in the center of the chest (like an elephant sitting on it).
2.  **Radiating Pain:** Pain spreading to the shoulders, neck, jaw, or arms (especially the left arm).
3.  **Shortness of Breath:** Difficulty breathing or gasping for air.
4.  **Autonomic Symptoms:**
    *   Cold sweat
    *   Nausea or vomiting
    *   Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness
    *   Pale, clammy skin

## Risk Factors Increasing Urgency
*   History of heart disease or previous heart attack.
*   Age > 45 (men) or > 55 (women).
*   Diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.
*   Smoker.

## Non-Cardiac Chest Pain (Lower Risk, but Consult Doctor)
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Pain that gets worse when pressing on the chest wall or moving the arms.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Burning sensation (heartburn) that worsens after eating or lying down, often relieved by antacids.
*   **Respiratory:** Sharp pain that worsens with deep breaths or coughing (pleuritic pain).

**Guidance:**
*   **RED FLAG:** If ANY "Critical Warning Sign" is present -> **EMERGENCY ESCALATION**.
*   **YELLOW FLAG:** If pain is persistent but lacks critical signs -> **URGENT CONSULT (Within 2-4 hours)**.
*   **GREEN FLAG:** If clearly related to movement or trauma -> **ROUTINE CARE**.
