# General Medication Safety

**Type:** Patient Education

## The "5 Rights" of Medication Safety
1.  **Right Patient:** Ensure the medication is for YOU. Never share prescription drugs.
2.  **Right Drug:** Check the label every time. Many pills look alike.
3.  **Right Dose:** Follow instructions exactly. Do not "double up" if you miss a dose unless directed.
4.  **Right Route:** Swallow, chew, or apply exactly as prescribed.
5.  **Right Time:** Take at the prescribed times to maintain effectiveness.

## Antibiotic Stewardship
*   **Viral Infections:** Antibiotics DO NOT kill viruses (Colds, Flu, most sore throats). Taking them for viruses increases antibiotic resistance.
*   **Complete the Course:** If prescribed antibiotics, finish the entire bottle even if you feel better, to prevent surviving bacteria from becoming resistant.

## Pain Relievers (OTC)
*   **Acetaminophen (Paracetamol/Tylenol):**
    *   *Risk:* Liver damage if taken in excess (>3000-4000mg/day).
    *   *Warning:* Check "Cold & Flu" combination medicines; they often contain acetaminophen. Do not double dose.
*   **NSAIDs (Ibuprofen/Advil, Naproxen/Aleve):**
    *   *Risk:* Stomach bleeding, kidney stress, or heart issues with long-term use.
    *   *Guidance:* Take with food to protect the stomach.

## Supplements & Interactions
*   "Natural" does not mean "Safe".
*   St. John's Wort interacts with antidepressants, birth control, and blood thinners.
*   Vitamin K interacts with Warfarin (blood thinner).
*   **Always list ALL supplements** when talking to a doctor or AI health assistant.
