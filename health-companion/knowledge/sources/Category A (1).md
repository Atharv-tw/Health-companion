If yo u cannot avo id contact, yo u can take steps to reduce the risk of the allergens or irritants causing sym ptoms, including: cleaning yo ur skin – if yo u come into contact with an allergen or irritant, rinse the affected skin with warm water and an emollient as soon as possible using glove s to protect yo ur hands – but take them off eve ry now and again, as sweating can make any sym ptoms worse; yo u may find it useful to wear cotton glove s underneath rubber glove s if the rubber also irritates you changing products that irritate yo ur skin – check the ingredients on make-up or soap to make sure it does not contain any irritants or allergens; in some cases, you may need to contact the manufacturer or check online to get this information applying emollients (Link: www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/emollients/) frequently and in large amounts – these keep yo ur skin hyd rated and help protect it from allergens and irritants; you could also use emollient soap substitutes rather than regular bar or liquid soaps, which can dry out yo ur skin Other types of eczema Other typ es of ecze ma include: atopic ecze ma (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/atopic-ecze ma/) (also called atopic dermatitis) – the most common type of ecze ma; it often runs in families and is linked to other conditions, such as asthma (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/) and hay feve r (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/hay-feve r/) discoid ecze ma (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/discoid-ecze ma/) – circular or ova l patches of ecze ma on the skin va ricose ecze ma (Link: www.nhs.uk/conditions/va ricose-ecze ma/) – this most often affects the lower legs; it's

A fever is defined by most healthcare provider as a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) and higher when taken rectally. The body has several ways to maintain normal body temperature. The organs involved in helping with temperature regulation include the brain, skin, muscle, and blood vessels. The body responds to changes in temperature by: When your child has a fever, the body works the same way to control the temperature, but it has temporarily reset its thermostat at a higher temperature. The temperature increases for a num ber of reasons:Increasing or decreasing sweat production. Moving blood away from, or closer to, the surface of the skin. Getting rid of, or holding on to, water in the body. Seeking a cooler or warmer environment. Chemicals, called cytokines and mediators, are made in the body in response to an invasion from a microorganism, malignancy, or other intruder. The body is making more macrophages, which are cells that go to combat when intruders are present in the body. These cells actually "eat-up" the invading organism. The body is busily trying to make natural antibodies, which fight infection. These antibodies will recognize the infection next time it tries to invade. Many bacteria are enclosed in an overcoat-like membrane. When this membrane is disrupted or broken, the contents that escape can be toxic to the body and stimulate the brain to raise the temperature.Health ( Cookie Preferences By clicking

The following conditions can cause a fever: What are the benefits of a fever? Fever is not an illness. It is a symptom, or sign that your body is fighting an illness or infection. Fever stimulates the body's defenses, sending white blood cells and other "fighter" cells to fight and destroy the cause of the infection. What are the symptoms that my child may have a fever? Children with fevers may become more uncomfortable as the temperature rises. In addition to a body temperature greater than 100.4°F (38°C), symptoms may include: The symptoms of a fever may look like other medical conditions. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, if your child is younger than 3 months of age and has a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher, you should call your child's healthcare provider immediately. If you are unsure, always check with your child's healthcare provider for a diagnosis.Infectious diseases Certain medicines Heat stroke Blood transfusion Disorders in the brain Some kinds of cancer Some autoimmune diseases Your child may not be as active or talkative as usual. He or she may seem fussier, less hungry, and thirstier. Your child may feel warm or hot.

( privacystatement/)1/13/26, 7:49 PM Fever in Children | Johns Hopkins Medicine 2/4 When should a fever be treated? In children, a fever that is making them uncomfortable should be treated. Treating your child's fever will not help the body get rid of the infection any faster; it simply will relieve discomfort associated with fever. Children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years can develop seizures from fever (called febrile seizures). If your child does have a febrile seizure, there is a chance that the seizure may occur again, but, usually, children outgrow the febrile seizures. A febrile seizure does not mean your child has epilepsy. There is no evidence that treating the fever will reduce the risk of having a febrile seizure. What can I do to decrease my child's fever? Give your child an antifever medicine, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. DO NOT give your child aspirin, as it has been linked to a serious, potentially fatal disease, called Reye syndrome. Other ways to reduce a fever: When should I call my child's healthcare provider? Unless advised otherwise by your child’s healthcare provider, call the provider right away if:Dress your child lightly. Excess clothing will trap body heat and cause the temperature to rise. Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids, such as juices, soda, punch, or popsicles. Give your child a lukewarm bath. Do not allow your child to shiver from cold water, as this can raise the body temperature. NEVER leave your child unattended in the bathtub. DO NOT use alcohol baths. Your child is 3 months old or younger and has a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher. Get medical care right away. Fever in a young baby can be a sign of a dangerous infection.

Taking your temperature You do not need to take your temperature using a thermometer, but you can if you have one. Make sure you use it correctly to help get an accurate result. To use a digital thermometer: 1. Clean the tip with cold water and soap, then rinse it. 2. Turn the thermometer on. 3. Put the tip under your tongue, towards the back of your mouth. 4. Close your lips around the thermometer. 5. Wait until it beeps or flashes. 6. Remove the thermometer and check the temperature on the display. You can also use a digital thermometer in your armpit. Make sure you keep your arm tight against your body until the thermometer beeps or flashes. Other types of thermometer If you use a digital ear thermometer, follow the instructions that come with it. You usually need to gently pull your ear up and back before putting the thermometer in your ear.
